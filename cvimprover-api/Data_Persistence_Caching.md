## Details

The `cvimprover` project's core architecture is built around Django's modular design, with `cvimprover.settings` serving as the central configuration hub, dictating database connections (PostgreSQL) and caching strategies (Redis). The `core.models` component, containing `User` and `Plan` models, defines the application's data structure and provides the ORM interface for database interactions. This setup ensures a clear separation of concerns, where configuration drives the behavior of the data models, enabling flexible and scalable data management within the application.

### core.models
This component defines the application's data schema, including tables, fields, and relationships, using Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). It serves as the primary interface for application-level interactions with the PostgreSQL database, abstracting raw SQL operations into Python objects and methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

### cvimprover.settings
This component acts as the central configuration hub for both the PostgreSQL database and the Redis caching backend. It defines connection parameters, database engines, caching strategies, and other environment-specific settings related to data persistence and caching, ensuring consistent and adaptable data access.
