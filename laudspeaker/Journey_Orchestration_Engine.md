## Details

This analysis outlines the architecture of the `Journey Orchestration Engine`, a critical subsystem responsible for executing automated, multi-step customer engagement workflows. The design is based on a clear separation of concerns, isolating the business logic from the technical implementation of workflow management.

### Journey Trigger
Acts as the entry point for all journeys. It listens for domain events (e.g., a user entering a segment) and initiates the journey process by invoking the `Journey Engine`.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `journeys/trigger.ts`


### Journey Engine
The primary business logic component. It is responsible for loading the correct journey definition from the database and preparing the initial context for the user. It does not execute the journey but delegates the entire workflow to the `Workflow Orchestrator`.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `journeys/index.ts`


### Workflow Orchestrator
An adapter for the underlying workflow technology (Temporal). It translates the abstract journey definition into a durable, stateful workflow. It manages the sequence of steps, handles long delays, and ensures the journey can survive service restarts.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `temporal/index.ts`


### Workflow Activities
A collection of stateless, atomic functions that implement the individual steps of a journey. Each activity represents a single unit of work, such as sending an email, waiting for a specified duration, or updating a user attribute.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `temporal/activities.ts`
