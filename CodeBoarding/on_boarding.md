## Details

The CodeBoarding system operates as a sophisticated pipeline for automated architectural documentation. It begins with the API Service receiving a request, which is then logged and managed by the Job Database. The Orchestration Engine serves as the central nervous system, coordinating the entire analysis process. It first directs the Repository Manager to fetch the target codebase. This code then undergoes structural examination by the Static Analysis Engine. The resulting raw data is intelligently processed by the AI Interpretation Layer, a suite of agents that abstract, detail, plan, validate, and analyze changes within the architecture. Finally, the refined architectural insights are passed to the Output Generation Engine to produce various documentation formats, completing the cycle by making the output accessible via the API Service. This design emphasizes a clear, sequential flow, distinct component responsibilities, and extensibility for future language and AI model integrations.
