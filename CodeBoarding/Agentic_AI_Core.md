## Details

After a thorough review and tool-based verification, it has been determined that the components outlined in the original analysis do not exist. The `CodeBoarding` package and its associated agent classes (`CodeBoardingAgent`, `PlannerAgent`, etc.) were not found. As a result, no components, responsibilities, or interactions can be described for this subsystem. The architectural model is empty pending the identification of valid components within the project.
