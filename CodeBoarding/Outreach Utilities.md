## Component Details

This component contains utility functions primarily used for external interactions with Git repositories. It automates tasks such as cloning repositories, copying generated analysis reports (markdown files) into a designated .codeboarding directory within the cloned repository, and then committing and pushing these changes.

### PR Utility Main
This component orchestrates the entire process of cloning a repository, copying onboarding documentation, and pushing changes. It takes an SSH URL as input and performs a series of steps including repository name extraction, directory management, file copying, and Git operations.
