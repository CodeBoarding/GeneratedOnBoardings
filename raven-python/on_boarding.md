## Details

The Raven SDK's architecture is designed around a clear, sequential data flow for error and event capture. The process begins with Application/Framework Integrations, which are specialized modules that hook into various host environments (e.g., Django, Flask, Celery). These integrations act as the initial entry points, detecting errors and extracting raw contextual data. This initial data is then passed to the Client Core, the central orchestrator of the SDK. The Client Core coordinates the entire event capture workflow. It interacts with the Context & Breadcrumb Manager to enrich the event with dynamic contextual information (like user data, HTTP details) and a chronological trail of actions (breadcrumbs) leading up to the error. Once the context is gathered, the Client Core delegates to the Event Builder, which is responsible for constructing the initial raw event payload, including stack traces and module versions. Finally, the constructed event payload is submitted to the Payload Pipeline & Transport component. This composite component handles the crucial steps of sanitizing, filtering, serializing (e.g., to JSON), compressing, and ultimately transmitting the event data to the Sentry server using various transport mechanisms. This modular design ensures a robust and extensible error reporting system.

### Application/Framework Integrations [[Expand]](./Application_Framework_Integrations.md)
These components serve as the initial capture points, integrating with various host applications and web frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, Celery, AWS Lambda). They are responsible for hooking into the application's lifecycle to detect errors and extract initial contextual data.
