## Details

The `Core Services & Utilities` component in DeepLabCut serves as the foundational layer, providing essential, low-level services and common functionalities that are pervasive across the entire library. Its structure is modular, organized into distinct sub-components that handle specific core tasks. The flow within this component involves configuration loading, data management, video processing, pose estimation result processing, metric computation, and various visualization outputs. Its primary purpose is to ensure robust, efficient, and consistent operations by centralizing critical functionalities, thereby supporting higher-level DeepLabCut workflows such as training, analysis, and evaluation. These components are fundamental because they collectively form the backbone of DeepLabCut's core functionality, providing essential setup, central control, pose processing, evaluation, low-level utilities, visualization, and benchmarking capabilities.

### Configuration & Core Engine
Manages project-wide configurations, data paths, and the central operational logic of DeepLabCut. It provides foundational data structures and ensures consistent settings across modules. The Engine class acts as a central hub for managing the overall state and flow of the application.
