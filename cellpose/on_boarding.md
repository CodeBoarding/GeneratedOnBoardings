## Details

The `cellpose` project is structured as a modular machine learning toolkit, designed for robust cellular image segmentation. At its core, the **Core ML Segmentation Engine** processes images, leveraging deep learning models to generate segmentation masks. This engine is supported by **Data Management (I/O)** for handling all input and output, and **Image Preprocessing** for preparing data. The system's extensibility is highlighted by the **Model Training** component, which allows for continuous improvement of the core models, and a dedicated **Denoising Module** for image quality enhancement. User interaction is facilitated through versatile **User Interfaces (GUI & CLI)**, which orchestrate the segmentation and training workflows, with results visually presented by the **Visualization** component. This architecture emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, enabling efficient data flow from raw image input to segmented output, and providing multiple access points for diverse user needs.

### Data Management (I/O)
Manages the loading of raw image data and associated labels, as well as the saving of processed segmentation masks and related outputs. It acts as the primary interface for data persistence.

### Image Preprocessing [[Expand]](./Image_Preprocessing.md)
Prepares raw image data for consumption by the core ML models. This includes normalization, resizing, and other transformations necessary for model input or data augmentation during training.

### Core ML Segmentation Engine [[Expand]](./Core_ML_Segmentation_Engine.md)
The central machine learning component. It encapsulates the Cellpose deep learning models, handles the forward pass for predicting cell probabilities and flow fields, and implements the algorithms to convert these raw outputs into discrete, labeled segmentation masks (flow following, mask refinement).

### User Interfaces (GUI & CLI) [[Expand]](./User_Interfaces_GUI_CLI_.md)
Provides interactive (GUI) and scriptable (CLI) access points for users to load data, run segmentation, and initiate training. It orchestrates interactions with the core ML components.
