## Component Details

The Benchmarking Suite provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance of the Theine caching library. It encompasses various benchmark types, including core cache operations, memoization decorator performance, and trace-based simulations. The suite facilitates performance analysis, optimization, and identification of potential bottlenecks within the caching library.

### Cache Core Benchmarks
This component focuses on benchmarking the fundamental cache operations such as read and write, employing different replacement policies to assess their impact on performance. It provides insights into the efficiency of the core caching mechanisms under various workloads.
