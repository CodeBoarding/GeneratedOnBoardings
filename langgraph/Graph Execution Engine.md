## Component Details

The Graph Execution Engine orchestrates the execution of a computational graph using a Pregel-inspired approach. It manages the iterative execution of tasks, data propagation, and state updates. The engine supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes, allowing for flexibility in handling different types of computational graphs. It also provides mechanisms for error handling, retries, and checkpoint management, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the graph execution process.

### PregelLoop
The PregelLoop class is the core component responsible for managing the iterative execution of tasks within the Pregel computation model. It handles task scheduling, data propagation, checkpoint management, and loop termination. It defines the basic structure for synchronous and asynchronous implementations.

### SyncPregelLoop
The SyncPregelLoop class provides a synchronous implementation of the PregelLoop, executing tasks sequentially to ensure synchronization between tasks. This is useful when tasks have dependencies or when deterministic execution is required.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.loop.SyncPregelLoop`

### AsyncPregelLoop
The AsyncPregelLoop class offers an asynchronous implementation of the PregelLoop, enabling concurrent task execution for improved performance when tasks are independent. This can significantly reduce the overall execution time for suitable graphs.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.loop.AsyncPregelLoop`

### PregelRunner
The PregelRunner class orchestrates the overall execution of the Pregel computation. It initializes the PregelLoop, manages the flow of tasks, and handles error conditions. It acts as the entry point for running the graph computation.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.runner.PregelRunner`

### local_read
The `local_read` function is responsible for reading data from the local state of a task. It provides access to data available within the current iteration of the Pregel loop, allowing tasks to access their input data.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.algo:local_read`

### apply_writes
The `apply_writes` function applies the writes generated by a task to the global state. It updates the computation's state based on the task outputs, ensuring that the results of each task are reflected in the overall computation.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.algo:apply_writes`

### prepare_next_tasks
The `prepare_next_tasks` function determines the next set of tasks to be executed based on the current state. It schedules tasks for the next Pregel loop iteration, ensuring that the computation progresses towards its final result.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.algo:prepare_next_tasks`

### get_runnable_for_task
The `get_runnable_for_task` function retrieves the runnable object for a given task. It provides the executable code for a task, allowing the PregelLoop to execute the task's logic.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.call:get_runnable_for_task`

### call
The `call` function executes a task by invoking its runnable object and returning the result. It is the core function for executing the individual tasks within the Pregel loop.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `langgraph.libs.langgraph.langgraph.pregel.call:call`
