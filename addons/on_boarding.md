## Details

The TensorFlow Addons project is structured around extending TensorFlow's core capabilities with specialized functionalities. The `Build & Environment Setup` component forms the foundation, managing the compilation and configuration necessary for the entire library, especially for custom C++/CUDA operations. This setup enables the `Core Integration & Registration` component, which provides the essential utilities and mechanisms for making custom components discoverable and usable within the TensorFlow ecosystem. Building upon this core, `Fundamental ML Building Blocks` offers a suite of advanced machine learning primitives like custom activations, losses, metrics, and optimizers. These blocks are extensively utilized by `Keras Model Extensions`, which introduces specialized neural network layers and callbacks to enhance Keras models. Finally, `Specialized ML Modules` provides domain-specific functionalities for image processing, natural language processing, and sequential data, often leveraging and extending the capabilities provided by the other components. This modular design ensures extensibility and clear separation of concerns, facilitating both development and integration into larger machine learning workflows.
