## Details

The DeepSpeed architecture is centered around the `DeepSpeed Core Engine`, which acts as the primary orchestrator for training and inference. This engine relies heavily on the `Configuration Manager` to initialize and apply various optimization settings, including those for memory efficiency (via `Zero Optimizer`), numerical stability (`Mixed-Precision Optimizers`), and memory reduction (`Activation Checkpointing`). For distributed training, the `DeepSpeed Core Engine` leverages `Distributed Communication` to manage data synchronization and gradient updates across multiple devices. Performance monitoring is handled by the `Profiler`, which provides insights back to the engine. Finally, the `Checkpoint Engine` ensures the persistence of training progress by managing the saving and loading of model and optimizer states. This modular design allows the DeepSpeed Core Engine to seamlessly integrate and coordinate these specialized components to achieve high-performance and memory-efficient deep learning.

### DeepSpeed Core Engine [[Expand]](./DeepSpeed_Core_Engine.md)
The central control plane and orchestrator for the entire DeepSpeed training and inference lifecycle. It encapsulates the core logic for managing model execution, applying various optimization techniques, and coordinating interactions with other DeepSpeed components.
