## Details

The `inbox.py` project implements a lightweight, asynchronous SMTP server designed for efficient email processing. The architecture is structured around a clear data flow, beginning with the `CLI Interface` (`inbox`) which acts as the initial configuration and launch point. This component hands off control to the `Server Orchestration` (`inbox.serve`), responsible for setting up the `asyncio` event loop and managing the server's lifecycle. The `Server Orchestration` then initializes the `SMTP Server Core` (`inbox.InboxServer`), which is dedicated to handling all aspects of the SMTP protocol, from receiving connections to parsing email data. Finally, the `SMTP Server Core` dispatches the parsed email content to the `Email Processing Logic (Collation Mechanism)` (`inbox.process_message`), providing a flexible extension point for custom email handling. This design emphasizes modularity and a clear separation of concerns, making it suitable for both embedded use and custom email processing workflows.

### CLI Interface
The application's entry point, handling command-line arguments and initiating the server's operation.
