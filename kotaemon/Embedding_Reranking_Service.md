## Details

The `kotaemon` project's embedding and reranking subsystem is designed with a strong emphasis on modularity and external service integration, crucial for a flexible Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. At its core, the system defines abstract interfaces, `embeddings.base` and `rerankings.base`, which establish contracts for various embedding models and reranking algorithms, respectively. Concrete implementations, such as `embeddings.openai` and `indices.rankings.cohere`, extend these interfaces to integrate with external AI services like the `external OpenAI API` for embeddings and the `external Cohere API` for reranking. This architecture allows for easy interchangeability of providers, enabling the system to adapt to evolving AI models and optimize retrieval performance without significant changes to the core RAG pipeline.

### embeddings.base
This abstract component defines the interface for all embedding models within the `kotaemon` framework. It ensures that various embedding providers can be integrated seamlessly, adhering to the "Modular/Plugin Architecture" principle.
