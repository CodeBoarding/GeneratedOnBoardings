## Details

The `Spout/Bolt Implementations` subsystem encompasses the user-defined Python classes that serve as the fundamental building blocks for data ingestion (Spouts) and data processing (Bolts) within a streamparse Apache Storm topology. This subsystem is responsible for the core data flow logic, from initial data entry into the stream to its transformation and aggregation.

### WordsSpout
As a core component of a Data Processing Framework, `WordsSpout` acts as a data source, continuously ingesting raw data (e.g., lines of text) into the stream processing pipeline. It is responsible for emitting these raw data units as tuples into the Storm topology, serving as the entry point for data flow.

### WordCountBolt
This component represents a processing unit within the stream processing pipeline. `WordCountBolt` receives tuples from upstream components (like `WordsSpout`), applies specific business logic (e.g., counting word occurrences), and then emits new, processed tuples downstream. It embodies the transformation and aggregation capabilities of the framework.
