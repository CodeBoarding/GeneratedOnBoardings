## Details

The `hflayers.transformer` subsystem introduces specialized `HopfieldEncoderLayer` and `HopfieldDecoderLayer` modules, designed to enhance standard Transformer architectures with Hopfield-based associative memory. The `HopfieldEncoderLayer` processes input sequences, leveraging its internal Hopfield association to produce an enriched encoded output. This encoded output is then consumed by the `HopfieldDecoderLayer`, which further processes it along with its own self-attention mechanisms to generate the final output sequence. Both layers manage their internal parameters, including those of their integrated Hopfield modules, through their respective `reset_parameters` methods, ensuring proper initialization and functionality within the larger Transformer model.

### HopfieldEncoderLayer
This component is a specialized PyTorch module that integrates Hopfield-based associative memory into the encoder stack of a Transformer architecture. Its core responsibility is to process input sequences, enhancing attention and memory capabilities within the encoder by leveraging Hopfield mechanisms. It acts as a drop-in replacement or enhancement for a standard Transformer encoder layer. During initialization, it calls its internal `reset_parameters` method to set up its weights and the associated Hopfield module.

### HopfieldDecoderLayer
This component is a specialized PyTorch module designed to integrate Hopfield-based associative memory into the decoder stack of a Transformer architecture. It is responsible for generating output sequences, utilizing Hopfield mechanisms to improve context understanding and generation quality. It interacts with both the outputs from the encoder and previous outputs from the decoder itself. Similar to the encoder, it initializes its parameters by calling its internal `reset_parameters` method.
