## Details

This component is designed to collect, process, and present crucial application events and operational metrics, providing insights into system health, user behavior, and task execution. It forms the foundation for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding overall application usage patterns.

### StatsUtility
This utility is responsible for the core logic of collecting and aggregating statistical data within the application. It likely provides methods for incrementing counters, recording events, and potentially calculating metrics like averages or rates.
