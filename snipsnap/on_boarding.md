## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Web Presentation Layer [[Expand]](./Web_Presentation_Layer.md)
The user-facing component responsible for handling HTTP requests, managing user sessions, and rendering dynamic web pages (JSPs). It acts as the primary entry point for user interactions.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Application Business Logic [[Expand]](./Application_Business_Logic.md)
Encapsulates the core business rules and orchestrates complex operations. It coordinates interactions between the presentation, content, security, and data persistence layers, applying business workflows.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Content & Security Management [[Expand]](./Content_Security_Management.md)
Manages the lifecycle of all content entities (e.g., wiki pages, blog posts) and handles user authentication, authorization (including ACLs), and user account management. It ensures content integrity and access control.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Data Persistence Layer [[Expand]](./Data_Persistence_Layer.md)
Provides an abstract interface for interacting with various data storage mechanisms (file-based, JDBC). It isolates the rest of the application from the specifics of data storage and retrieval.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Content Rendering Engine [[Expand]](./Content_Rendering_Engine.md)
Transforms raw content (e.g., wiki markup, blog post text) into displayable formats, typically HTML, utilizing templating engines like Radeox and a custom macro engine.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Extension & Integration Services [[Expand]](./Extension_Integration_Services.md)
Manages the discovery, loading, and lifecycle of various plugins (storage, RSS, rendering) and facilitates communication with external systems, including blogging APIs (XML-RPC) and notification services (Jabber). It also handles system-wide configuration loading.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
