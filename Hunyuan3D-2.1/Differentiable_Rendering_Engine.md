## Details

The Differentiable Rendering Engine subsystem is a critical component within the Hunyuan3D-2.1 project, serving as the core for rendering 3D meshes and enabling differentiable operations essential for both shape generation and texture synthesis. A core rendering engine capable of rendering 3D meshes and performing differentiable operations, crucial for both shape generation and texture synthesis.

### MeshRender
This component orchestrates the differentiable rendering pipeline. It is responsible for managing mesh and texture data, executing rendering passes, handling UV operations, and acting as the core engine for generating 2D representations from 3D models. It also facilitates projecting information back onto the mesh, making it fundamental for differentiable operations.

### mesh_utils
This component provides essential utilities for handling 3D mesh data. Its responsibilities include loading and saving mesh data, managing internal data conversions, and serving as the primary interface for persistent storage and retrieval of 3D model data for the rendering engine.
