## Component Details

These two components, `Internal API Completion` and `RedTeaming`, are fundamental to the RagaAI Catalyst platform. `Internal API Completion` is the core backend service for API requests and data persistence, while `RedTeaming` ensures system security and robustness by identifying vulnerabilities. Their interdependency is crucial, as `RedTeaming` relies on `Internal API Completion` for testing, and its findings inform improvements to the API, creating a vital feedback loop for system enhancement.

### Internal API Completion
The `Internal API Completion` component is the central backend service responsible for processing all internal API requests and managing data persistence within the RagaAI Catalyst platform. It acts as a critical communication hub, facilitating data exchange and operations across various client-side and internal components.
