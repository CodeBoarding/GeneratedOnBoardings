**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Export & Publishing Service
Handles the publication aspect, making finalized questionnaires available. This includes generating DDI-compliant outputs and managing publication workflows.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Metadata Management Service
A crucial supporting component that ensures all questionnaire elements are richly annotated. It is responsible for defining, storing, and retrieving DDI-specific metadata for instruments and questions, integral to the design and publication process.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Validation Service
Ensures the quality and compliance of the designed questionnaires, which is an inherent part of managing their lifecycle. It validates instrument designs and metadata against DDI standards and business rules.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
