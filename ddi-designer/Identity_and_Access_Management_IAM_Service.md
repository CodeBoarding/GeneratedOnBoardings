## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Authentication Manager
Handles user login processes, validates credentials (e.g., username/password), and issues authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) upon successful verification. It is the primary entry point for user identity verification.
