## Details

The user is explaining why they cannot provide source code references. They are stating that they need 'Project Context (`meta_context`)', 'CFG Data', and 'Subsystem Boundaries' to accurately map abstract components to their corresponding source code. They are also explicitly saying 'I cannot update the analysis with source code references at this time.' and asking for `project_name` and `meta_context`. The model should acknowledge the user's explanation and limitations. It should not try to call `AnalysisInsights` because the user is explicitly stating they *cannot* provide the necessary information for source code references, which is a part of the `AnalysisinsightsComponentsReferencedSourceCode` within `AnalysisinsightsComponents`. The user is essentially saying 'I can't do what you asked because I'm missing information X, Y, Z. Please provide X and Y.' The model's response should reflect an understanding of this.
