## Component Details

Component Overview: Storefront & Content Management

### Site Configuration
This component is responsible for managing global settings and configurations that apply across the entire storefront. This includes fundamental shop details (e.g., header text, description), contact information, default units (weight), digital product settings, email sender details, stock reservation durations, and gift card expiry rules. It also defines which navigation menus are used as the primary top and bottom menus.

### Static Content Pages
This component is dedicated to the creation, management, and display of static informational content pages on the storefront.
