## Component Details

### SettingsService
The SettingsService is a central component responsible for managing the application's configuration settings. It provides a unified interface for accessing and modifying settings, ensuring consistent behavior across the application. It initializes and holds the application settings, including authentication settings and database URLs.

### SettingsServiceFactory
The SettingsServiceFactory is responsible for creating instances of the SettingsService. It decouples the creation process from the usage, allowing for flexible instantiation and potential customization of the SettingsService based on different environments or configurations.

### get_settings_service
The `get_settings_service` function acts as a dependency injection point for the SettingsService. It ensures that a single instance of the SettingsService is available throughout the application, promoting code reusability and simplifying access to configuration settings.
