## Details

The `usaddress` library's core functionality for parsing address strings is centered around a pipeline that transforms raw input into structured, tagged address components. This process begins with the `tokenize` component, which breaks down the address string into individual tokens. These tokens are then fed into the `tokens2features` component, responsible for generating a rich set of features for each token, leveraging the `tokenFeatures` component. The `tokenFeatures` component, in turn, utilizes helper functions like `digits` and `trailingZeros` to extract specific numeric and pattern-based characteristics. This feature engineering prepares the data for a probabilistic model, enabling accurate classification and structuring of address elements.

### tokenize
This component is responsible for the initial transformation of a raw, unstructured address string into a list of discrete, ordered tokens. It acts as the entry point for the pre-processing pipeline, breaking down the input into manageable units using regular expressions.

### tokens2features
This component takes the list of tokens generated by `tokenize` and transforms them into a comprehensive feature set. It orchestrates the feature extraction process for the entire sequence of tokens, preparing the data for the probabilistic model by adding 'previous' and 'next' token features.

### tokenFeatures
This component is responsible for analyzing a single token and extracting a rich set of features relevant for address parsing. These features capture various characteristics such as capitalization, numeric properties, and specific patterns, which are crucial for the probabilistic model's classification.

### trailingZeros
A utility component that checks if a given token (specifically a numeric one) contains trailing zeros. This specific feature can be important for distinguishing certain address components (e.g., "100" vs. "10").

### digits
A utility component that analyzes the numeric composition of a token, identifying if it contains digits and potentially other numeric-related characteristics. This helps in classifying tokens as numbers, postal codes, or other numeric address elements.
