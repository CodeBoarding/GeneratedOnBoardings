## Details

The `pycoin` core subsystem is designed to handle fundamental blockchain operations, primarily focusing on the structure, serialization, and cryptographic integrity of blocks and transactions. At its heart, the `pycoin.block.Block` component serves as the primary container, encapsulating `pycoin.coins.Tx` instances, which represent individual transactions. The subsystem relies heavily on `pycoin.serialize.streamer` for efficient binary serialization and deserialization of these data structures, enabling their storage and transmission. Cryptographic integrity is maintained through `pycoin.encoding.hash`, which provides essential hashing functions for block headers, transaction IDs, and Merkle tree computations. The `pycoin.merkle` component specifically handles the construction and verification of Merkle roots, ensuring the integrity of transactions within a block. Additionally, the subsystem incorporates `pycoin.encoding.b58` and `pycoin.contrib.bech32m` for address encoding, supporting both traditional and modern Bitcoin address formats. Finally, `pycoin.bloomfilter` offers a probabilistic mechanism for efficient transaction lookups, particularly useful for light clients.
