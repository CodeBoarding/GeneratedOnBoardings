## Details

The Model Optimization & Interoperability subsystem is responsible for enhancing the performance of deep learning models and ensuring their compatibility across various frameworks. Its boundaries encompass functionalities related to model size reduction, inference speed improvement (e.g., through quantization), and utilities for converting model weights and architectures between different deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Flax. It acts as a bridge, allowing models to be optimized and seamlessly used in diverse framework environments.

### Quantization Utilities
This component provides the core mechanisms and base classes for applying quantization techniques to deep learning models. Its primary goal is to reduce model size and accelerate inference by representing model weights and activations with lower precision data types.

### Framework Interoperability Utilities
This component is dedicated to facilitating the conversion of model weights and architectures between different deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Flax). It ensures that models trained or defined in one framework can be effectively utilized or deployed in another, promoting flexibility and reusability.
