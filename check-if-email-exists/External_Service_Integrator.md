## Details

Conceptual components for an email verification system. Source code references are not provided as the project is identified as a Rust project, not Python, making Python-based source code analysis inapplicable for finding these references.

### EmailVerificationCore
This is the central component encapsulating the primary business logic for email verification. It orchestrates the various steps required to determine an email's validity, including syntax checks, domain validation, and deliverability assessments. It acts as the orchestrator, delegating specific external interactions to the `External Service Integrator`.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### External Service Integrator [[Expand]](./External_Service_Integrator.md)
Abstracts and manages interactions with external services critical for email verification. This includes performing DNS lookups for MX records and potentially direct SMTP server communication for deliverability checks. It provides a clean interface for the `EmailVerificationCore` to interact with external systems without needing to know the underlying implementation details.
