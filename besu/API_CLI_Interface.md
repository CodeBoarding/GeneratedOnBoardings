## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### API & CLI Interface [[Expand]](./API_CLI_Interface.md)
Provides external interfaces for users and applications to interact with the blockchain client, including JSON-RPC/WebSockets for programmatic access and a command-line interface for client management.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Blockchain Core [[Expand]](./Blockchain_Core.md)
The central component responsible for managing the blockchain's data structure, including blocks, transactions, and the overall state. It handles block validation, chain synchronization, and maintaining the canonical chain.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Network/P2P
Manages connections to other nodes in the blockchain network, facilitating peer discovery, propagation of transactions, and synchronization of blocks.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Consensus Engine [[Expand]](./Consensus_Engine.md)
Implements the blockchain's specific consensus mechanism (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake), ensuring agreement among nodes on the state of the ledger and the validity of new blocks.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### EVM (Execution Environment)
Provides the runtime environment for executing smart contract code and processing transactions according to the rules of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Data Persistence [[Expand]](./Data_Persistence.md)
Handles the storage and retrieval of all blockchain-related data, including blocks, transactions, state data, and receipts, typically using a key-value store.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Sync Manager
Orchestrates the process of synchronizing the local blockchain state with the current state of the network, including fetching missing blocks and verifying chain integrity.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Cryptography
Offers cryptographic functions essential for secure operations, including hashing, digital signatures, and key management, used for transaction signing, block validation, and peer authentication.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
