## Database Migrations Overview

This diagram illustrates the flow of database migrations in Django, focusing on the key components involved in detecting, creating, and applying migrations.

### Component Descriptions:

*   **Project State (From/To):** Represents the state of the Django project's models at different points in time. The `MigrationAutodetector` compares the 'from' and 'to' states to identify changes.
    *   **Relevant source files:** N/A (Conceptual)

*   **Migration Autodetector:** This component is responsible for comparing two project states and generating a set of migration operations required to transition from one state to the other. It identifies differences in models, fields, and options.
    *   It uses `django.db.migrations.autodetector.MigrationAutodetector` to perform the comparison and generate operations.
    *   **Relevant source files:** `django.db.migrations.autodetector.MigrationAutodetector`

*   **Migration Operations:** These are the individual actions that need to be performed on the database schema, such as creating tables, adding fields, or altering indexes. They are generated by the `MigrationAutodetector` and stored within a `Migration`.
    *   **Relevant source files:** `django.db.migrations.operations`

*   **Migration:** Represents a single migration file. It contains a list of `Migration Operations` to be applied or unapplied to the database. Migrations are applied in a specific order, determined by their dependencies.
    *   **Relevant source files:** `django.db.migrations.migration.Migration`

*   **BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor:** An abstract base class that provides methods for applying schema changes to the database. It offers a database-agnostic interface for creating, deleting, and altering database schemas.
    *   **Relevant source files:** `django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`

*   **Migration Recorder:** This component manages the `django_migrations` table, which tracks the migrations that have been applied to the database. It records and unrecords migrations as they are applied or rolled back.
    *   It uses `django.db.migrations.recorder.MigrationRecorder` to interact with the `django_migrations` table.
    *   **Relevant source files:** `django.db.migrations.recorder.MigrationRecorder`

*   **Database:** The actual database where the project's data is stored. The schema is modified by the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` based on the `Migration Operations`.
    *   **Relevant source files:** N/A (External)
