## Component Details

This graph illustrates the core components and their interactions within the ComfyUI application. The `Core Application & Orchestration` component serves as the central hub, managing startup, configuration, and orchestrating the main execution flow. It interacts with various specialized components for model management, frontend operations, user settings, custom node handling, and logging. The `Workflow Execution Engine` is responsible for processing computational graphs, utilizing `Node Operations` to perform specific tasks. Overall, this structure ensures a modular and extensible design for ComfyUI's operations.

### Core Application & Orchestration
Manages the fundamental operations of ComfyUI, including application startup, argument parsing, logger setup, custom path management, and orchestrating the main prompt execution loop. It also handles model file management, frontend interactions, user settings, and custom node installations. This component is responsible for the initial setup of the ComfyUI application, including applying custom paths and loading extra configuration settings.
