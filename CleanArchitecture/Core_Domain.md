## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Core Domain [[Expand]](./Core_Domain.md)
The Core Domain component is the innermost layer of the application, encapsulating the enterprise-wide business rules, domain entities, value objects, and domain events. It represents the pure business logic, free from any external dependencies on application, infrastructure, or presentation layers. This isolation ensures that the core business rules remain stable and untainted by technological concerns.
