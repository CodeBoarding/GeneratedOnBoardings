## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) & Database Abstraction
This component provides the core Object-Relational Mapper, abstracting direct database interactions. It handles data persistence, retrieval, transaction management, and caching, allowing higher-level components to work with Python objects rather than raw SQL. It leverages psycopg2 for PostgreSQL connectivity.
