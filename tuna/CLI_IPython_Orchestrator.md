## Details

The `CLI & IPython Orchestrator` subsystem encompasses the user-facing interfaces for the `tuna` project, specifically handling command-line interactions and IPython magic commands. Its core components are found within `tuna.cli.py` and `tuna.magics.py`, which then delegate to the central orchestration logic in `tuna.main.py`. The subsystem is designed with a clear delegation pattern, where both the `CLI Handler` and `IPython Integration` components serve as distinct user-facing entry points, interpreting user input and delegating core application logic to the `Core Orchestrator` for execution. This design ensures a separation of concerns, promoting modularity and reusability of the orchestration layer.

### CLI Handler
This component serves as the primary command-line interface for the `tuna` application. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, validating user input, and initiating the appropriate profiling or visualization workflows based on the commands provided by the user.

### IPython Integration
This component provides seamless integration with IPython and Jupyter environments. It enables users to interactively profile and visualize data directly within their notebooks or IPython sessions via the `%tuna` magic command, offering a more dynamic user experience.

### Core Orchestrator
This is a central component that encapsulates the core logic for initiating and managing the main functionalities of `tuna`, such as reading profile data, rendering visualizations, and starting the web server. It acts as the execution engine, receiving commands from both the CLI and IPython interfaces.
