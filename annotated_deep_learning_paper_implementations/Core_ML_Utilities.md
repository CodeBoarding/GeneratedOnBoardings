## Details

The Core ML Utilities subsystem provides the foundational infrastructure for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models within the labml_nn project. It encapsulates core functionalities related to data management, model optimization, training orchestration, and essential neural network building blocks.

### Trainer
Orchestrates the entire machine learning training process. It manages epochs, iterations, data loading, model updates, and integrates with other helper modules for metrics and optimization. It is the central orchestrator for the training loop.

### Datasets
Provides functionalities for loading, transforming, and managing various datasets, making them ready for consumption by training loops. It abstracts data access and preprocessing.

### Optimizers
Implements various optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) responsible for updating model parameters based on gradients computed during training. This component also includes general optimizer helpers and learning rate scheduling.
