## Details

The `espeak` backend subsystem is orchestrated by the `wrapper` component, which serves as the high-level Pythonic interface, abstracting the complexities of the `espeak-ng` C library. The `wrapper` delegates the core text-to-phoneme conversion to the `espeak` component and manages the selection and configuration of `voice` properties. Both `wrapper` and `espeak` components utilize the `api` component, which is responsible for managing the low-level interface and lifecycle of the `espeak-ng` shared library. The `espeak` component, embodying the core phonemization strategy, consumes `voice` data for accurate conversion. Additionally, the `mbrola` component extends the core phonemization by leveraging `espeak`'s foundational logic for specialized MBROLA voice handling.

### wrapper
Acts as the primary high-level Pythonic interface for the Espeak Backend. It abstracts away the complexities of the underlying `espeak-ng` C library, providing a clean API for phonemization. It orchestrates the overall phonemization process within this backend. This component serves as an Adapter, standardizing interaction with the `espeak-ng` specific logic.

### espeak
Contains the core concrete phonemization logic. This component directly interacts with the `espeak-ng` library to perform the actual text-to-phoneme conversion and handles post-processing of the raw output. It embodies the core "Strategy" for `espeak-ng` phonemization.

### api
Manages the low-level interface and lifecycle of the `espeak-ng` shared library. This includes loading, unloading, and resolving the library's path, ensuring proper initialization and cleanup. This component is crucial for bridging Python with the native `espeak-ng` library.

### voice
Represents and manages properties of `espeak-ng` voices. It facilitates the selection and configuration of voices, which is crucial for accurate phonemization. This component handles configuration and data management specific to `espeak-ng` voices.

### mbrola
Handles specific integration and phonemization logic for MBROLA voices, often used in conjunction with `espeak-ng` for higher quality speech synthesis. It leverages shared post-processing logic from `espeak`. This component represents a specialized variant or extension of the core phonemization strategy.
