## Details

The `Runtime Core` is fundamental because it acts as the contract layer for all runtime operations. By defining `AbstractRuntime`, it allows for a clear separation between the *what* (the interface) and the *how* (the concrete implementations). This enables new runtime types to be added without altering existing code, adhering to the Strategy/Plugin pattern. The Pydantic data models within `Runtime Core` establish a universal language for commands, observations, and session management. This standardization is critical for interoperability between different parts of the system (e.g., `Server Layer` communicating with `Concrete Runtimes`) and ensures data integrity. The configuration schemas provide a structured and validated way to set up and customize various runtime environments, making the system adaptable to diverse deployment scenarios. In essence, `Runtime Core` provides the essential blueprint and communication protocols that underpin all execution within the sandboxed environments, making it a cornerstone of the entire remote execution framework.

### Runtime Core [[Expand]](./Runtime_Core.md)
This component establishes the foundational contract for all runtime environments within SWE-ReX. It defines the `AbstractRuntime` interface, which specifies the core functionalities for command execution, observation handling, and session management within sandboxed environments. Additionally, it provides essential Pydantic data models (e.g., `Command`, `Observation`, `CreateBashSessionRequest`) and configuration schemas (e.g., `LocalRuntimeConfig`, `RemoteRuntimeConfig`) that ensure consistent data exchange and configuration across all concrete runtime implementations. This component is crucial for maintaining a clear separation of concerns and enabling the Strategy pattern for different runtime behaviors.
