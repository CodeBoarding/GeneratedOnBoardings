## Details

High-level data flow overview of a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Zig.

### LSP Communication Layer [[Expand]](./LSP_Communication_Layer.md)
Handles all communication with the LSP client (IDE/editor), parsing incoming LSP requests and serializing outgoing LSP responses and notifications. It dispatches requests to the appropriate internal components and receives results/diagnostics for client publication.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Document Management [[Expand]](./Document_Management.md)
Responsible for maintaining an in-memory representation of all open and managed source code files. It handles document synchronization events and provides the latest content of files to other components.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Parser & AST Representation [[Expand]](./Parser_AST_Representation.md)
Takes Zig source code from the Document Management component and transforms it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This component also handles the initial detection of syntax errors.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Semantic Analysis Engine [[Expand]](./Semantic_Analysis_Engine.md)
Performs deeper analysis of the AST to understand the meaning and correctness of the code. This includes type checking, symbol resolution, scope management, and detecting semantic errors, building and maintaining a symbol table.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Feature Implementations [[Expand]](./Feature_Implementations.md)
Encompasses the implementation of all specific Language Server Protocol features (e.g., Code Completion, Go-to-Definition, Hover Information, Formatting, Refactoring), leveraging the AST and semantic information.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Configuration Management [[Expand]](./Configuration_Management.md)
Manages server-side and workspace-specific configurations received from the LSP client. It provides configuration settings to other components, influencing their behavior.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Error & Diagnostic Reporting [[Expand]](./Error_Diagnostic_Reporting.md)
Collects and aggregates syntax and semantic errors, warnings, and other diagnostic messages generated by the Parser and Semantic Analysis Engine. It then formats these diagnostics according to the LSP specification for publication to the client.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
