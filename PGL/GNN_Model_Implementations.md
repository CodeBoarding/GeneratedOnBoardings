## Details

The `PGL` (Paddle Graph Learning) library's neural network (`nn`) subsystem is designed for building and implementing various Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. At its core, the `Message Passing Engine` provides the fundamental operations for information propagation across graph structures. This engine underpins the `pgl.nn.conv` module, which houses diverse graph convolution operations, and the `pgl.nn.pool` module, responsible for graph pooling techniques. Together, these modules form the `GNN Model Implementations` component, offering a modular and extensible framework for developing advanced GNN architectures. The design emphasizes clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible combination of convolution and pooling layers to construct complex graph models.

### GNN Model Implementations [[Expand]](./GNN_Model_Implementations.md)
This top-level component provides a comprehensive set of Graph Neural Network architectures and their fundamental layers. It leverages the `Message Passing Engine` for core operations and embodies a modular design, allowing for interchangeable convolution, attention, and pooling layers. It is primarily composed of the `pgl.nn.conv` and `pgl.nn.pool` modules.

### pgl.nn.conv
This module aggregates various graph convolution operations. Its responsibility is to define how information from a node's neighbors is aggregated and transformed to update the node's representation, directly utilizing the `Message Passing Engine`.
