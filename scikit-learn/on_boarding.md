## Component Details

### Core Estimators and Base Classes
This component defines the fundamental building blocks for all machine learning models in scikit-learn. It includes the `BaseEstimator` class, which provides the basic interface for all estimators, as well as mixin classes like `ClassifierMixin`, `RegressorMixin`, and `TransformerMixin` that add specific functionalities. It also provides utilities for parameter management and model cloning, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different models.
