## Details

The `basic_verilog` project is structured around a collection of hardware design modules, primarily implemented in Verilog, intended for synthesis onto FPGAs or ASICs. The core functionality is segmented into distinct components: `Arbitration Modules` manage shared resource access, `Arithmetic Modules` perform optimized mathematical operations, and `Communication Modules` handle data encoding and decoding for inter-module data exchange. These functional blocks are underpinned by a `Clock & Reset Management` component, which provides essential timing and initialization signals, ensuring synchronous operation across the design. `Utility & Helper Modules` offer reusable logic blocks that support the primary components, enhancing design efficiency. `Specialized & HLS IP` represents highly optimized or automatically generated intellectual property, often leveraging vendor-specific features for performance gains. Finally, `Testbenches` are integral for verifying the functional correctness of all designed IP blocks, simulating their behavior and validating outputs. The architecture emphasizes modularity and reusability, with clear dependencies on clock and reset signals, and a robust testing framework.

### Arbitration Modules
Manage access to shared resources, prioritize requests, and ensure fair allocation among multiple requesters. These modules are critical for resource contention resolution in multi-master or multi-channel systems.
