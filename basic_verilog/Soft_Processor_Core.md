## Details

The subsystem is centered around a Soft Processor Core, which serves as the programmable computational engine. This core interacts directly with Memory & Data Structure Modules for instruction fetching and data manipulation, and with Interface & Protocol Modules to communicate with external peripherals. Clock & Reset Management provides the essential timing and initialization signals for the processor's synchronous operation. Finally, Board Support Packages (BSPs) represent the higher-level integration layer, where the Soft Processor Core is instantiated and configured within a complete system design.

### Soft Processor Core [[Expand]](./Soft_Processor_Core.md)
The central programmable element, capable of executing instructions and orchestrating complex operations. This is the core of the subsystem, directly aligning with the "Soft Processor Cores" architectural pattern.
