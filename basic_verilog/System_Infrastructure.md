## Details

The core of this hardware subsystem revolves around precise clock and reset management, along with the distribution of critical global signals. The Clock Generation Unit (CGU) is responsible for synthesizing and generating all necessary clock signals, which are then efficiently distributed throughout the design by the Clock Distribution Network (CDN) to various Synchronous Modules. Concurrently, the Reset Management Unit (RMU) ensures a controlled system startup and state initialization by providing synchronized reset signals to these same synchronous modules. Beyond clocks and resets, the Global Signal Distributor (GSD) handles the broad dissemination of other essential control signals, such as enables and interrupts, to various Various Modules. For robust communication between different clock domains, the Asynchronous/Clock Domain Crossing (ADC/CDC) Synchronizers act as crucial intermediaries, safely transferring signals from Source Clock Domain Modules to Destination Clock Domain Modules, leveraging the distributed clock signals from the CDN to prevent metastability issues. This structured approach ensures reliable and synchronized operation across the entire hardware design.

### Clock Generation Unit (CGU)
Responsible for generating primary and derived clock signals from a reference clock. This includes functionalities like PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops) or DCMs (Digital Clock Managers) for frequency synthesis, clock multiplication/division, and phase shifting.
