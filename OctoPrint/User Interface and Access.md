## Component Details

The User Interface and Access component in OctoPrint manages the web-based user interface, user accounts, groups, and permissions. It handles HTTP requests, serves static assets, and provides API endpoints for interacting with the core system. It also manages user authentication, authorization, and session management, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience. The central point is the OctoPrint server which initializes and configures the user and group managers, web views, and API endpoints.

### OctoPrint Server
