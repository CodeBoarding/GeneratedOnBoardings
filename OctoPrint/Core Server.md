## Component Details

The Core Server component in OctoPrint is responsible for managing the entire OctoPrint instance. It initializes and coordinates various sub-systems, including the web server, plugin manager, settings, and printer communication. It handles the main application loop and orchestrates the interaction between different components. The server exposes API endpoints for file management, printer control, settings, system information, and plugins. It also manages the web interface views and rendering.
