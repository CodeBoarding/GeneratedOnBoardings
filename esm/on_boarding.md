## Component Details

The `esm` project provides a comprehensive suite of tools for protein language modeling and structure prediction. Its main flow involves loading pre-trained models, processing protein sequence data, and then applying these models for tasks such as sequence embedding, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) based analysis, 3D structure prediction via ESMFold, or inverse folding to design sequences for given structures. The architecture is modular, separating concerns like model loading, core neural network components, data handling, and specific model implementations (ESM, ESMFold, Inverse Folding) with an application layer orchestrating these functionalities.

### Model Loading and Management
Handles loading and managing various pre-trained ESM models and their associated alphabets, including local file loading and downloading from a hub. It serves as the primary entry point for users to obtain model instances.

### Core Neural Network Infrastructure
Provides the fundamental neural network layers and modules, such as multi-head attention, normalization layers, feed-forward networks, and rotary positional embeddings, which serve as the building blocks for various transformer architectures within the project.

### Data Processing and Utilities
Manages the input data for the models, including reading sequence data from FASTA files, batching sequences for efficient processing, and defining the alphabet (vocabulary) used for tokenization. It also includes general data utilities for various tasks.
