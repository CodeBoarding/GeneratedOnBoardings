## Details

The `syncedlyrics` architecture is structured as a modular utility library, designed for efficient lyric retrieval. The system's entry point is the `Command-Line Interface (CLI)`, which processes user requests and initiates the core operations. These operations are managed by the `Core Application Logic`, acting as a facade that orchestrates the lyric search. This core component interacts with various `Specific Lyric Providers` through a standardized `Lyric Provider Abstraction`, allowing for seamless integration of new lyric sources. Each specific provider encapsulates the unique logic for fetching lyrics from its respective online platform. Both the `Core Application Logic` and the `Specific Lyric Providers` leverage a shared `Lyric Utility & Helper Functions` component for common tasks such as data manipulation, file handling, and web scraping, promoting code reusability and maintaining a clean separation of concerns within the project.
