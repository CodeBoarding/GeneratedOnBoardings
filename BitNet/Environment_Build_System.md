## Details

The project's build process is orchestrated by the `Core Build Orchestrator (CMake)`, which serves as the central control point. Before compilation can begin, the `Environment Provisioning Script` prepares the necessary build and runtime environment, installing dependencies and setting up prerequisites that the `Core Build Orchestrator (CMake)` then utilizes. This script also directly provides specific dependencies required by the `Custom Kernel Compiler`. During the build, the `Core Build Orchestrator (CMake)` invokes and coordinates the `Custom Kernel Compiler` to generate optimized binaries for custom CUDA/GPU kernels. Once compiled, these binaries are produced by the `Custom Kernel Compiler` and integrated back into the main project by the `Core Build Orchestrator (CMake)`, completing the build cycle.

### Environment Provisioning Script
This component is responsible for automating the setup of the project's build and runtime environment. It handles dependency installation (e.g., Python packages, system libraries, CUDA toolkit paths) and ensures that all prerequisites for compilation are met.

### Core Build Orchestrator (CMake)
As the central build system, this component manages the overall compilation, linking, and packaging of the entire project. It coordinates the compilation of C++ components, integrates external libraries like `llama.cpp`, and orchestrates the specialized compilation of custom kernels.

### Custom Kernel Compiler
This specialized component focuses solely on compiling the project's custom CUDA/GPU kernels. It takes source code for performance-critical operations and generates highly optimized, hardware-specific binaries, which are then linked into the main project.
