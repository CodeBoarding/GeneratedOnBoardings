## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Advanced Dynamics & Flow [[Expand]](./Advanced_Dynamics_Flow.md)
This core component encapsulates specialized mathematical and dynamic modeling utilities. It provides the foundational elements for handling continuous-time dynamics, including ODE solvers and flow matching techniques, potentially operating on various mathematical manifolds. It is crucial for advanced research in areas like generative models and continuous control within the VLA context, supporting advanced modeling paradigms.
