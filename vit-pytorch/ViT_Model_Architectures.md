## Details

The `vit-pytorch` project implements various Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, focusing on image processing through self-attention mechanisms. The core components include the `ViT` model, which processes image patches using `Transformer` blocks. `CaiT` is an enhanced variant that refines the `Transformer` usage for improved stability. `MaxViT` introduces a hybrid approach, combining `MBConv` blocks with attention for robust feature extraction. The `Transformer` component, central to these models, is composed of `Attention` and `FeedForward` layers, which handle sequence processing and non-linear transformations, respectively. `LayerScale` is a crucial mechanism utilized within the `Transformer` blocks to stabilize training, particularly in deeper models like `CaiT`.
