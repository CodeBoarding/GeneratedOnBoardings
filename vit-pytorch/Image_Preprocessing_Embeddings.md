## Details

The Image Preprocessing & Embeddings subsystem is defined by the core functionalities of preparing raw image data for Vision Transformer models. Its boundaries encompass the transformation of images into a sequence of patch embeddings and the addition of positional information.

### RearrangeImage
This component is responsible for adapting the input image's dimensions to a format suitable for subsequent patch extraction. It acts as the initial step in the image preprocessing pipeline, ensuring the image tensor has the correct shape for partitioning.

### PatchEmbedding
This component takes the preprocessed image data, divides it into non-overlapping patches, flattens each patch, and then linearly projects these flattened patches into a higher-dimensional embedding space. It generates the fundamental "tokens" that represent the image content for the transformer model.

### PositionalEmbedding
This component generates and applies positional embeddings to the sequence of tokens produced by PatchEmbedding. Its crucial role is to encode the spatial information of each patch, as transformer architectures are inherently permutation-invariant and require explicit positional cues to understand the relative arrangement of image patches.
