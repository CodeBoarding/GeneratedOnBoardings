  "content": "## Invariant Explorer Overview\n\nThe Invariant Explorer is launched using a Docker Compose setup, which includes a web application and a database. The `launch_explorer` function acts as the entry point, creating an `ExplorerLauncher` instance to manage the setup and launch process. The `ExplorerLauncher` ensures that all necessary dependencies, such as Docker Compose, the Docker network, and the database, are ready before launching the web application. The web application then connects to the database to display the analysis results.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph User\n        A[User] --> B(launch_explorer)\n    end\n    B -- creates --> C(ExplorerLauncher)\n    C -- uses --> D(docker_compose_setup)\n    C -- uses --> E(config_file)\n    C -- ensures --> F(DatabaseSetup)\n    C -- launches --> G(WebApp)\n    G -- reads data from --> F\n    G -- displays to --> A\n\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n\n\n```\n\n### Component Descriptions\n\n*   **launch\_explorer**: Entry point for launching the explorer. It parses arguments, creates an `ExplorerLauncher` instance, and calls its methods to start the explorer.\n    *   Source file: `invariant/explorer/launch/launch_explorer.py`\n\n*   **ExplorerLauncher**: Manages the lifecycle of the explorer, including downloading configurations, setting up the environment, ensuring database readiness, and launching the web application.\n    *   It uses `docker_compose_setup` and `config_file` to download necessary configurations.\n    *   It ensures the database is ready using `DatabaseSetup`.\n    *   It launches the `WebApp` using Docker Compose.\n    *   Source file: `invariant/explorer/launch/ExplorerLauncher.py`\n\n*   **docker\_compose\_setup**: Downloads the Docker Compose configuration file from a remote repository.\n    *   It is used by `ExplorerLauncher` to obtain the Docker Compose configuration.\n    *   Source file: `invariant/explorer/launch/docker_compose_setup.py`\n\n*   **config\_file**: Downloads the configuration file for the explorer from a remote repository.\n    *   It is used by `ExplorerLauncher` to obtain the explorer's configuration.\n    *   Source file: `invariant/explorer/launch/config_file.py`\n\n*   **DatabaseSetup**: Handles the setup and migration of the database used by the Invariant Explorer.\n    *   It is used by `ExplorerLauncher` to ensure the database is ready before launching the web application.\n    *   Source file: `invariant/explorer/db/DatabaseSetup.py`\n\n*   **WebApp**: Represents the web application component of the Invariant Explorer. It handles routing, serving static files, and interacting with the database to display analysis results.\n    *   It reads data from the `DatabaseSetup` component.\n    *   It displays the data to the user.\n    *   Source file: `invariant/explorer/webapp/WebApp.py`",
