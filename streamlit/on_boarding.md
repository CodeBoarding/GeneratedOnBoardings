## Component Details

The Streamlit architecture is designed to enable rapid development of interactive data applications. The core functionality revolves around the Application Core, which manages the execution of user scripts, application state, and data caching. This core interacts with the User Interface API, allowing developers to define and render various UI elements and widgets. Communication between the backend (Application Core) and the frontend (browser) is handled by the Web Communication component, which uses HTTP and WebSockets. A robust Configuration & Utilities layer provides essential services like settings management, logging, and general helper functions. External Data Connectors enable seamless integration with various data sources. Development & Deployment Tools assist in the application lifecycle, including CLI operations and live reloading. The entire system is validated through comprehensive Testing Frameworks, and demonstrated via built-in Demonstration Apps. Finally, Vendored Libraries provide specific third-party functionalities.

### Application Core
The central execution environment of a Streamlit application. It manages session lifecycle, script execution, state persistence, data caching, and the flow of messages between the backend and frontend. It orchestrates how user scripts are run and how their outputs are processed and prepared for display.
