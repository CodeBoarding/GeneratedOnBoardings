## Details

The `bindsnet.network` subsystem forms the core of the Spiking Neural Network simulation. The `bindsnet.network.network` component acts as the central orchestrator, responsible for the overall execution and training of the SNN. It integrates and manages instances of `bindsnet.network.nodes`, which define the behavior of individual neurons, and `bindsnet.network.topology`, which establishes and maintains the synaptic connections between these neurons. Spikes generated by `bindsnet.network.nodes` are propagated through the connections defined by `bindsnet.network.topology`, which in turn delivers inputs to other `bindsnet.network.nodes`, completing the neural network's operational cycle. This modular design allows for flexible construction and simulation of various SNN architectures.

### bindsnet.network.network
This is the central control unit for the entire Spiking Neural Network. It is responsible for initializing the network, managing its execution flow (e.g., `run` method), and overseeing the training process (`train` method). It acts as the primary interface for interacting with and controlling the SNN.

### bindsnet.network.nodes
Defines the fundamental properties and dynamic behaviors of individual spiking neurons. It handles how neurons process inputs, manage their internal states (e.g., membrane potential, thresholds), and decay over time. This component supports various computational kernel types (e.g., `EtaKernel`, `AlphaKernel`) that dictate the neuron's response to spikes.

### bindsnet.network.topology
Manages the structural organization and synaptic connections between different neuron populations within the network. It defines how neurons are interconnected, including the properties of synapses (e.g., weights, delays) and how spikes propagate through these connections.
