## Details

The `Brownian Motion Generation` subsystem is a critical part of `torchsde`, responsible for providing the necessary stochastic noise for SDE solvers.

### BrownianInterval
This is the fundamental component responsible for the actual generation, interpolation, and state management of a Brownian motion path. It acts as the underlying engine that provides stochastic noise data points as needed by SDE solvers. Its design reflects the "Computational Graph/Dataflow" pattern by efficiently managing and providing access to the stochastic process, which is crucial for differentiable SDE computations.

### DerivedBrownianMotion
This component serves as a factory or utility layer for creating and managing instances of `BrownianInterval`. It simplifies the instantiation process for users and other internal components, providing convenient methods to obtain pre-configured Brownian motion objects. This aligns with the "Modular Design" and "Extensible Framework" patterns, abstracting the complexity of `BrownianInterval` creation.
