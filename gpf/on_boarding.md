## GPF Project Overview

The GPF (Genomic Prediction Framework) project is a comprehensive platform designed for managing, analyzing, and querying large-scale genomic data. It provides tools for importing, storing, annotating, and querying genetic variants and phenotype data, with a focus on supporting research in areas such as rare disease genetics and personalized medicine. The platform includes a web application (WDAE) that offers user-friendly interfaces for data exploration and analysis.

## Component Descriptions

**GPF Instance:** This component is the central manager of the entire GPF system. It loads configurations, manages access to genomic resources, variant data, and phenotype data. It configures and manages the Genomic Resources component and provides access to Variant and Phenotype Management components. The Web API uses the GPF Instance to access the underlying data and functionalities.

**Genomic Resources:** This component handles the storage, retrieval, and management of genomic resources such as reference genomes, gene models, and annotation databases. It provides genomic data to the Variant Management component for annotation and analysis. The GPF Instance configures and manages this component.

**Variant Management:** This component encompasses the import, storage, annotation, and querying of genetic variants. It integrates data from various sources, annotates variants using genomic resources, and provides efficient querying capabilities. It integrates and analyzes data with the Phenotype Management component and provides variant data to the Web API for visualization and analysis.

**Phenotype Management:** This component deals with loading, storing, and querying phenotype data associated with individuals and families. It allows for integrating phenotype data with genotype data for comprehensive analysis. It integrates with the Variant Management component for combined genotype-phenotype analysis and provides phenotype data to the Web API.

**Web API (WDAE):** This component provides a set of RESTful APIs for accessing and managing data and functionalities within the WDAE web application. It enables user management, dataset access, and various analysis tools. It uses the GPF Instance to access data and functionalities, and it receives variant and phenotype data from the Variant and Phenotype Management components, respectively.
