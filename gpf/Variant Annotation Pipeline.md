## Variant Annotation Pipeline Overview

The Variant Annotation Pipeline annotates genetic variants with functional effects and other relevant information. It uses configurable annotation pipelines to integrate data from various sources. The pipeline relies on genomic resources like reference genomes and gene models to accurately predict the impact of variants.
