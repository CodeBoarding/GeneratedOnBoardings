## Details

The system is designed to process video streams for motion segmentation and object recognition. It operates by acquiring video frames, calculating dense optical flow to detect motion, segmenting moving regions, and then applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object inference. The processed outputs, including visualizations of optical flow, segmented objects, and classification results, are rendered in real-time and can be written to video files for persistence. The `main` function acts as the central orchestrator, managing the flow of data and control between these specialized components.

### Video Stream Manager [[Expand]](./Video_Stream_Manager.md)
The central orchestrator of the entire video processing pipeline. It initializes and manages the lifecycle of all other components, coordinating the sequential and parallel data flow between them. Its primary role is to ensure frames are acquired, processed through optical flow, segmentation, and CNN inference, and then displayed or saved.

### Video Frame Acquirer
Responsible for obtaining raw video frames from various input sources, such as video files or live camera feeds. It acts as the entry point for all video data into the processing pipeline.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `cv::VideoCapture`


### Dense Optical Flow Calculator
Computes dense motion vectors between consecutive video frames using algorithms like Farneback's method. This component provides the foundational motion data for subsequent analysis.

### CNN Inference Engine
Performs object classification or other inference tasks on the segmented regions using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (e.g., Caffe models). It provides semantic understanding of the detected motion.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `DNN`


### Processed Output Renderer
Visualizes the various stages of processing, including raw frames, optical flow visualizations, motion segmentation masks, and the results of object classification. It provides real-time feedback and debugging capabilities.


**Related Classes/Methods**:
