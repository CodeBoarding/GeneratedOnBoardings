## Response Rendering Overview

This component is responsible for rendering the API response into a specific format, such as JSON or HTML. It receives data from the serializers and formats it for the client. It also handles content negotiation to determine the appropriate renderer based on the client's request.

graph LR
    APIView --> ContentNegotiation

    RendererSelection -- selects --> Renderer
    Renderer -- renders --> Response
    Response -- sends to --> Client

        RendererSelection[Renderer Selection]
    end

    subgraph Rendering
        Renderer[Renderer (JSONRenderer, TemplateHTMLRenderer, etc.)]
        Response[Response]
    end

### Component Descriptions:

*   **APIView**: The base class for all API views. It receives the request, processes it, and prepares the data for rendering. It uses ContentNegotiation to select the appropriate renderer.
    *   Relevant source files: `rest_framework.views.APIView`

*   **ContentNegotiation**: Determines the appropriate renderer to use based on the client's request (e.g., Accept header). It selects a renderer from the available renderers.
    *   Relevant source files: `rest_framework.negotiation.ContentNegotiation`, `rest_framework.negotiation.DefaultContentNegotiation`

*   **Renderer Selection**: This is part of the content negotiation process. Based on the client's `Accept` header and the available renderers, the appropriate renderer is selected.
    *   Relevant source files: `rest_framework.negotiation.DefaultContentNegotiation`

*   **Renderer**: An abstract class that defines the interface for rendering data into a specific format. Concrete renderers (e.g., JSONRenderer, TemplateHTMLRenderer) implement this interface.
    *   Relevant source files: `rest_framework.renderers.Renderer`

*   **Response**: A class that encapsulates the rendered data and the HTTP headers. It is returned by the API view and sent to the client.
    *   Relevant source files: `rest_framework.response.Response`

*   **Client**: The user or application that consumes the API.
