## Details

The twitter-api-client project is structured around a set of specialized service components that interact with a foundational API client core. At its heart, the ApiClientCore acts as the central communication layer, handling all direct HTTP/HTTPS interactions with the X/Twitter API endpoints (both GraphQL and V1). This core component is responsible for the low-level mechanics of sending requests and receiving responses. Building upon this core, several distinct service components manage specific functionalities: AuthenticationService: Orchestrates the entire user authentication process, from acquiring guest tokens to executing login flows and managing session token updates. It initiates requests through the ApiClientCore to handle authentication-related API calls. AccountService: Provides a high-level interface for interacting with user-specific functionalities on X/Twitter, such as fetching profile information, managing tweets, and handling media uploads. It sends its requests to the ApiClientCore for execution. ScrapingService: Focuses on extracting public data from X/Twitter, managing the logic for querying, paginating, and processing responses. It makes its data retrieval requests through the ApiClientCore. SearchService: Specializes in executing and processing search queries across the X/Twitter platform, managing parameters and result retrieval. It dispatches its queries to the ApiClientCore for API interaction. This architecture promotes clear separation of concerns, with each service component focusing on a specific domain, while ApiClientCore provides a unified and robust communication backbone.
