## Details

The `mlx-lm` project's fine-tuning subsystem is orchestrated by the `LoRA Fine-tuning Orchestrator`, which initiates and manages the entire process. It `utilizes` the `Data Loading & Preparation` component to prepare datasets and `delegates to` the `Training Loop Core` for the iterative optimization process. The `Training Loop Core` is central to the training, `relying on` `Loss Functions` for gradient computation and `integrating` both `LoRA Layer Implementation` and `DoRA Implementation` to apply low-rank adaptation techniques. Notably, `DoRA Implementation` is designed to `support` `Quantization Algorithms`, allowing it to operate on and potentially re-quantize models that have undergone quantization, thereby enabling efficient fine-tuning of compressed models. This modular design allows for flexible integration of various adaptation and optimization techniques.

### LoRA Fine-tuning Orchestrator
Acts as the high-level entry point and orchestrator for the LoRA fine-tuning workflow. It manages the end-to-end process, including initiating training and evaluation.

### Data Loading & Preparation
Provides utilities for loading, preprocessing, and preparing datasets from various sources (e.g., local files, Hugging Face Hub) for the fine-tuning process.

### LoRA Layer Implementation
Contains the specific architectural implementations of LoRA layers, enabling low-rank adaptation within models.

### DoRA Implementation
Provides the core logic for applying DoRA (Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation) to models, including converting base layers and fusing weights. It is designed to be compatible with both unquantized and quantized linear layers.

### Quantization Algorithms
This acts as a collective component encompassing various quantization algorithms (dwq, dynamic_quant, awq, gptq). Each sub-module within `mlx_lm.quant` is responsible for implementing its specific quantization technique to reduce model size and optimize for inference.
