### Component Descriptions

**1. Command Line Interface (CLI):** This is the entry point for users interacting with MarkItDown. It receives user input (e.g., file paths, URLs), passes it to the `MarkItDown Core`, and displays the final Markdown output. It relates to the `MarkItDown Core` by calling its conversion methods and receiving the converted output for display. click <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/GeneratedOnBoardings/blob/main/markitdown//Command Line Interface.md">A</a>

**2. MarkItDown Core:** The central orchestrator of the conversion process. It manages the registration of available `Document Converters`, handles input streams via the `Stream Information Handler`, selects the appropriate converter, and returns the final `Markdown Output`. It relates to the `Stream Information Handler` by using it to determine the input type, to the `Document Converters` by selecting and calling the appropriate converter, and to the `Markdown Output` by receiving the converted markdown. click <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/GeneratedOnBoardings/blob/main/markitdown//MarkItDown Core.md">B</a>

**3. Stream Information Handler:** This component analyzes the input stream (file, URL, or data stream) to determine its type (mimetype, extension, charset). This information is crucial for the `MarkItDown Core` to select the correct `Document Converter`. It relates to the `MarkItDown Core` by providing information about the input stream, and to the `Document Converters` by helping the `MarkItDown Core` to select the appropriate converter. click <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/GeneratedOnBoardings/blob/main/markitdown//Stream Information Handler.md">C</a>

**4. Document Converters:** A collection of specialized converters, each responsible for converting a specific document type (e.g., HTML, DOCX, PDF) into Markdown. The `MarkItDown Core` selects a converter based on the stream information. It relates to the `MarkItDown Core` by performing the actual conversion when called, and to the `Markdown Output` by generating the converted markdown. click <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/GeneratedOnBoardings/blob/main/markitdown//Document Converters.md">D</a>

**5. Markdown Output:** Represents the final Markdown content generated by the conversion process. It encapsulates the converted Markdown text and any associated metadata. It relates to the `Document Converters` by receiving the converted markdown, and to the `Command Line Interface` by providing the final output for display. click <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/GeneratedOnBoardings/blob/main/markitdown//Markdown Output.md">E</a>
