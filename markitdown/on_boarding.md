## Component Descriptions

-   **User Input (File, URL, Stream):** Represents the various ways a user can provide content to be converted, including local files, URLs, and data streams.
-   **MarkItDown:** The central class that receives user input, determines the input type, selects the appropriate converter, and returns the final Markdown output. It orchestrates the entire conversion process.
-   **StreamInfo:** A data class that encapsulates information about the input stream, such as its mimetype, extension, and URL. This information is crucial for selecting the correct converter.
-   **Converter:** An abstract component representing a converter module. Each converter is responsible for converting a specific file format to markdown.
-   **DocumentConverterResult:** A data class that encapsulates the result of a document conversion, containing the converted markdown and title.
-   **Markdown Output:** The final Markdown content generated by the conversion process, ready for use.
