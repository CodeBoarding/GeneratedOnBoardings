## MarkItDown: High-Level Data Flow Overview

MarkItDown is a versatile tool designed to convert various file formats and data sources into Markdown. It supports a wide range of input types, from plain text and HTML to more complex formats like DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and even data sources like RSS feeds and Wikipedia articles. The core functionality revolves around identifying the input type, selecting the appropriate converter, and generating Markdown output.

### Component Descriptions:

*   **Command-Line Interface:** This component serves as the entry point for the application. It parses command-line arguments, such as the input file or URL, and passes this information to the Stream Information Handling component. It also receives the final Markdown output from the Core Conversion Engine and writes it to either standard output or a specified file.

*   **Stream Information Handling:** This component analyzes the input stream to determine the file type, encoding, and other relevant information. It uses both user-provided hints (from the command line) and content-based detection to make an informed guess. The determined information is then passed to the Core Conversion Engine to select the appropriate converter.

*   **Core Conversion Engine:** This is the central component of the application. It manages the overall conversion process, including registering available converters, selecting the appropriate converter based on the input file type (determined by Stream Information Handling), and orchestrating the conversion process. It receives the stream information from the Stream Information Handling component and uses the selected converter to generate Markdown output.

*   **Converters:** This component represents a collection of individual converters, each responsible for converting a specific file type or data source into Markdown format. The Core Conversion Engine selects the appropriate converter based on the input file type. Converters may utilize Converter Utilities to preprocess data.

*   **Converter Utilities:** This component provides utility functions and classes to support the converters. These utilities might include preprocessing steps for specific file formats (e.g., DOCX) or handling specific data types within files. Converters use these utilities to facilitate the conversion process.
