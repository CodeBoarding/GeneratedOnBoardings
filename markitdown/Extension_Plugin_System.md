## Details

The `markitdown` project is designed to convert various document types into a unified format. The core conversion process is managed by the `Markitdown` class, which acts as the central orchestrator. It leverages a plugin system to extend its capabilities, allowing external modules to register their own `DocumentConverter` implementations. The `Markitdown` class handles the loading and activation of these plugins, ensuring that all available converters are registered and prioritized correctly. When a conversion request is made, the `Markitdown` instance iterates through the registered converters, attempting to process the input until a suitable converter is found or all options are exhausted.

### Plugin Loader
This component is responsible for discovering and dynamically loading Python modules that are registered as `markitdown.plugin` entry points. It ensures that plugins are loaded efficiently (only once) and includes mechanisms to handle potential errors during the loading process, maintaining the stability of the plugin system.

### Plugin Activator
This component orchestrates the activation of the loaded plugins. It iterates through the discovered plugins and invokes their designated `register_converters` method. Crucially, it passes the `Markitdown` instance itself to these methods, enabling plugins to interact with the core system and register their specific `DocumentConverter` implementations.

### Converter Registration Interface
This component provides the public API endpoint through which `DocumentConverter` instances are registered with the `Markitdown` core. It manages the internal collection of converters, including their priority, which is critical for determining the order in which conversion attempts are made by the core engine.

### Core Conversion Engine
This component represents the central processing unit for document conversions. It receives input data and, utilizing the registered `DocumentConverter` instances, attempts to transform the data into the desired output format. It manages the conversion workflow, including selecting the appropriate converter based on input characteristics and handling the conversion process.
