## Details

The `Keep API Client` subsystem is primarily encapsulated within the `gkeepapi` Python package. It serves as the core interface for interacting with the Google Keep API, adhering to API Client Library architectural patterns.

### Keep API Client [[Expand]](./Keep_API_Client.md)
The central facade and orchestrator for all Google Keep API interactions. It manages the overall API session, coordinates authentication, dispatches high-level requests, and handles synchronization and CRUD operations on Keep entities (notes, lists). It acts as the primary interface for external consumers.
