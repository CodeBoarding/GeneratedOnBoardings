## Details

The `gkeepapi` library functions as a robust API client, orchestrating interactions with the Google Keep service through a well-defined architectural flow. The core process begins with the `Keep API Client` acting as the primary facade, handling user authentication via the `Authentication Manager`. Once authenticated, the `Keep API Client` dispatches high-level requests, which are then translated into low-level HTTP operations by the `Request Dispatcher`. This dispatcher communicates directly with the Google Keep API, receiving raw JSON responses. These raw responses are subsequently processed by the `Data Mapper/Serializer`, which transforms them into structured Python objects represented by the `Keep Data Models`. Conversely, when local changes to `Keep Data Models` need to be synchronized with the API, the `Data Mapper/Serializer` converts these Python objects back into JSON for the `Request Dispatcher` to send. This clear separation of concerns ensures efficient data flow, robust error handling, and maintainable code, making it ideal for diagrammatic representation. The `gkeepapi` architecture is centered around the `Keep API Client`, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with Google Keep. This client delegates authentication responsibilities to the `Authentication Manager` and relies on the `Request Dispatcher` for all low-level HTTP communication with the Google Keep API. Data exchanged with the API, typically in JSON format, is seamlessly converted to and from structured Python objects (`Keep Data Models`) by the `Data Mapper/Serializer`. This design ensures a clear, unidirectional flow of data and control, from user-initiated actions through the `Keep API Client`, to network requests handled by the `Request Dispatcher`, and finally to data representation managed by the `Data Mapper/Serializer` and `Keep Data Models`, making it highly suitable for visual flow graph representation.

### Keep API Client [[Expand]](./Keep_API_Client.md)
The main entry point and orchestrator for all interactions with the Google Keep API. It acts as a facade, managing the overall API session, coordinating authentication, dispatching high-level requests, and handling synchronization and CRUD operations on Keep entities.

### Request Dispatcher [[Expand]](./Request_Dispatcher.md)
Responsible for the low-level details of constructing, sending, and receiving raw HTTP requests and responses from the Google Keep API. It includes retry mechanisms for handling expired authentication tokens.

### Data Mapper/Serializer [[Expand]](./Data_Mapper_Serializer.md)
Handles the bidirectional conversion between the raw JSON data exchanged with the Google Keep API and the structured Python objects defined in the Keep Data Models. It performs object serialization (Python objects to JSON) and deserialization (JSON to Python objects).

### Keep Data Models
A collection of classes and enumerations representing the structured data of Google Keep entities (e.g., Notes, Lists, ListItems, Labels, Images). These models encapsulate data and provide basic entity-specific logic, including tracking changes.
