## Component Details

Analysis of fundamental components and their relationships for the MCP Server Integration, which extends the agent's capabilities by connecting to external Multi-Capability Platform (MCP) servers.

### MCPAggregator
This component is responsible for aggregating capabilities (tools, prompts, resources) from multiple connected MCP servers. It presents a unified interface to the agent, allowing it to discover and interact with these external services seamlessly. It acts as the central point for capability exposure.

### MCPConnectionManager
Manages the lifecycle of connections to individual MCP servers. This includes establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections. It ensures that the MCPAggregator has access to active and valid server connections.

### ServerRegistry
Stores and provides configuration details for known MCP servers. This component acts as a directory for MCP servers, allowing the MCPConnectionManager to retrieve necessary information (e.g., addresses, authentication details) to establish connections.

### MCPServerSettings
This class defines the structure and properties for configuring individual MCP servers. It's used by the ServerRegistry to store server-specific details and by the MCPConnectionManager to interpret these settings for connection establishment.
