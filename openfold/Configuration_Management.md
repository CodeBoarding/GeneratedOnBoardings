## Details

This set of components is fundamental because it covers the entire lifecycle of a deep learning project: defining the experiment (Configuration Management), building the model (Core Model Architecture), preparing the data (Data Pipeline & Feature Generation), optimizing the learning process (Loss Functions & Training Utilities), and scaling the training (Distributed Training & Optimization). The `Configuration Management` component acts as the central orchestrator, ensuring that all other components operate consistently based on the defined experimental parameters.

### Configuration Management [[Expand]](./Configuration_Management.md)
This component is responsible for centralizing and managing all model hyperparameters, architectural settings, and data processing pipeline configurations. It uses `ml_collections.ConfigDict` to provide a structured and hierarchical way to define parameters. It also includes functions to enforce constraints on configurations and offers predefined presets for various training and inference scenarios.
