## Details

The document processing subsystem is designed around a flexible, multi-stage pipeline. It begins with the `BaseDocumentLoader`, an abstract component that standardizes the ingestion of diverse data types into a uniform `Document` object. Following ingestion, the `CharacterTextSplitter` component takes on the crucial role of segmenting these documents into smaller, contextually relevant chunks. This modular design ensures that the system can efficiently handle various data sources and prepare them for subsequent processing steps, such as embedding or language model input, while maintaining data integrity and contextual coherence.

### BaseDocumentLoader
This abstract component defines the standard interface for loading documents from diverse data sources (e.g., files, web pages, databases). It provides a unified mechanism for synchronous, asynchronous, and lazy loading, ensuring flexibility in how data is retrieved. Its primary responsibility is to abstract away the complexities of data source specifics, presenting a consistent `Document` object for downstream components.

### CharacterTextSplitter
This component is responsible for segmenting large blocks of text into smaller, manageable chunks based on character-level rules. This transformation is critical for preparing text for models that have input token limits, ensuring that each chunk retains contextual relevance. It supports various splitting strategies, including language-specific rules, to optimize the chunking process for different use cases.
