## Component Details

This subsystem, 'Data Processors', is responsible for all image and video related preprocessing and postprocessing tasks within the `diffusers` library. It encompasses a suite of specialized processors that handle various data manipulations, including resizing, cropping, normalization, binarization, color format conversions (e.g., PIL to NumPy to PyTorch tensors and vice-versa), and specific adaptations for different model architectures like LDM3D and PixArt, as well as video data. The core functionality is built upon a base image processor, which is then extended by more specialized processors to meet diverse requirements.

### Core Image Processing
Provides fundamental image preprocessing and postprocessing functionalities, including resizing, normalization, binarization, color format conversion (RGB/grayscale), and conversions between PIL, NumPy, and PyTorch tensor formats. It also includes utilities for image cropping and overlay application.

### Specialized Image Mask Processing
Extends core image processing to handle and downsample image masks, specifically for integration with attention mechanisms like IP-Adapter.
