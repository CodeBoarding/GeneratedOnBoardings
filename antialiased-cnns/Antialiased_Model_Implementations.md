## Details

The antialiased_cnns subsystem provides a collection of antialiased convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Each central component within this subsystem, such as AntialiasedAlexNet or AntialiasedResNet, encapsulates the complete definition and implementation of its respective model. These components are designed to be self-contained, offering distinct, ready-to-use antialiased CNN models. The primary flow involves an external system utilizing one of these models for tasks like inference or training, with the model internally handling its specific architectural computations. There are no direct interaction pathways or dependencies between these distinct model implementations at this architectural level.

### AntialiasedAlexNet
