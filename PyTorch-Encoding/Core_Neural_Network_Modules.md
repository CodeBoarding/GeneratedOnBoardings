## Details

The `PyTorch-Encoding` project's `encoding.nn` subsystem provides a suite of specialized neural network modules designed to enhance model capabilities, particularly in areas like attention, regularization, and feature encoding. These individual modules, such as `encoding.nn.attention`, `encoding.nn.dropblock`, and `encoding.nn.encoding`, serve as core building blocks that are composed within the conceptual `Model Definitions` component to form complete and complex neural network architectures. A key internal dependency exists where the `encoding.nn.syncbn` module depends on and wraps the lower-level `encoding.functions.syncbn` for distributed batch normalization. Furthermore, the custom loss functions provided by `encoding.nn.loss` are utilized by the `Training/Inference Pipelines`, which orchestrate the overall training and evaluation workflows, demonstrating how these specialized components integrate into the broader machine learning lifecycle.

### Model Definitions
