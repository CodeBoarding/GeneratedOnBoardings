## Details

Analysis of the 'Visualization Engine' in 'deeptools', detailing its structure, core modules, and inter-component relationships for generating diverse graphical representations from processed genomic data.

### Visualization Engine [[Expand]](./Visualization_Engine.md)
This component is dedicated to the generation of diverse graphical representations from processed genomic data and analysis results. It encompasses functionalities for creating heatmaps, profile plots, scatter plots, and PCA plots. It acts as the primary interface for transforming numerical data into insightful visual outputs, relying on internal data structures (matrices) and external plotting libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.
