## Details

The OpenMC simulation framework is orchestrated by the `Model` component, which integrates various aspects of a nuclear simulation. The `Settings` component defines global simulation parameters, while the `Source` specifies the initial particle conditions. The physical environment is described by `Geometry`, which is composed of `Material` definitions. `Tallies` are used to define the quantities to be measured during the simulation. Upon execution, the `Model` produces a `StatePoint` file, which encapsulates the simulation results. For post-processing and visualization, the `Plot` component utilizes the `Geometry` and `StatePoint` data to generate visual representations of the simulation. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible and modular simulation design and analysis.

### openmc.Model
Acts as the central orchestrator for defining and running an OpenMC simulation, bringing together `Settings`, `Source`, `Geometry`, and `Tallies`. It provides the primary interface for initiating and managing a simulation run.

### openmc.Settings
Encapsulates all simulation-wide parameters, such as the number of particles, batches, criticality settings, and output options.
