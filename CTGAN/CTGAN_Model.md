## Details

The CTGAN subsystem is orchestrated by the `CTGAN` component, which serves as the primary interface and training manager. It is responsible for instantiating and coordinating the `Generator` and `Discriminator` neural networks, which form the core of the adversarial training process. The `Generator` creates synthetic data, while the `Discriminator` evaluates its authenticity, providing crucial feedback. Both the `Generator` and `Discriminator` leverage `Residual` blocks to build deeper and more stable network architectures. During their operation, both the `Generator` and `Discriminator` directly utilize the `_apply_activate` utility function to apply various activation functions, including the specialized `_gumbel_softmax` for handling categorical data. The `CTGAN` orchestrator also utilizes the `_cond_loss` function to compute conditional loss, enabling the generation of synthetic data based on specified conditions. This architecture highlights a clear separation of concerns, with `CTGAN` managing the overall training flow and the `Generator` and `Discriminator` handling the core data generation and evaluation tasks, supported by specialized utility components.

### CTGAN
The primary orchestrator and public API for the CTGAN model. It manages the entire training lifecycle, including initializing the Generator and Discriminator, executing their adversarial training loops, and handling data sampling. It embodies the "Model Implementations," "Training Logic," "Sampling/Generation Logic," and "Public API/Interface" patterns.
