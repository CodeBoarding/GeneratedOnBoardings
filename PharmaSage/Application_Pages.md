## Details

The application's core architecture is built around Next.js's file-system based routing and component structure. The `RootLayout` component establishes the global UI, including navigation and authentication, and acts as the primary container for all other page-specific content. The `Home` component represents the main landing page, responsible for rendering the application's initial user interface and guiding users to key functionalities. During data fetching or initial rendering of pages, the `Loading` component provides a visual indication to the user, enhancing the perceived performance and user experience.

### Page Component
