## Component Details

Final Component Overview

### Figma API Integration (Files)
This component, primarily embodied by the `Files` class within `tkdesigner.figma.endpoints`, is solely responsible for all interactions with the Figma REST API. It encapsulates the logic for authenticating requests using a Figma token, fetching raw design file data, and retrieving specific image assets by their IDs. It also includes robust error handling for network and API-related issues, ensuring reliable communication with the Figma platform.
