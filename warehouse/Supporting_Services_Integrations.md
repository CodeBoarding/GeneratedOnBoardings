## Details

Architecture Overview:
The warehouse subsystem serves as a critical backend for managing various core functionalities, including background task processing, caching, email communications, subscription management, and security integrations. It interacts extensively with both internal application components, represented by Application Frontends & APIs, and a range of External Cloud Services & Data Sources to deliver its services. This architecture ensures efficient operation, scalability, and robust handling of external dependencies, centralizing key business logic and integrations within the warehouse domain.

Synthesized Insights:
The warehouse subsystem is designed to handle a variety of asynchronous and synchronous operations, offloading heavy tasks to warehouse.tasks for efficient processing. Its warehouse.cache component is crucial for performance, interacting directly with external CDNs. Email functionalities, managed by warehouse.email, integrate with external services for sending and status updates. Subscription services, provided by warehouse.subscriptions.services, orchestrate interactions with payment gateways. Security is a key focus, with warehouse.integrations.vulnerabilities.osv processing data from external vulnerability databases and warehouse.integrations.secrets.utils handling sensitive information disclosures from external scanning tools. The warehouse.utils.sns module provides general utilities for interacting with AWS SNS, primarily for message verification. The subsystem's services are consumed by various Application Frontends & APIs, which include the main web application, user interfaces, authentication systems, and administrative tools.

### warehouse.tasks
