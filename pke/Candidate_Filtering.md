## Details

The Keyphrase Candidate Selection subsystem, centered around the `Candidate Filtering` component, is responsible for refining raw keyphrase candidates. This component, represented by the `pke.base.Pke` class, orchestrates the application of various rules to eliminate unsuitable candidates. A key helper in this process is the `Alphanumeric Validator`, implemented by `pke.base._is_alphanum`, which ensures that candidates adhere to alphanumeric constraints. This modular design allows for robust and extensible candidate refinement, ensuring only high-quality keyphrases proceed to further processing stages.

### Candidate Filtering [[Expand]](./Candidate_Filtering.md)
This is the core component of the subsystem. It is responsible for refining the initial set of raw keyphrase candidates by applying a series of predefined rules. Its primary function is to eliminate undesirable, malformed, or irrelevant entries, ensuring that only high-quality and valid candidates proceed to subsequent stages of the keyphrase extraction pipeline (e.g., weighting and ranking). This aligns with the "Keyphrase Candidate Selection Modules" pattern by providing a dedicated, pluggable stage for candidate refinement.

### Alphanumeric Validator
This component serves as a low-level utility function specifically designed to validate if a given string consists exclusively of alphanumeric characters. It acts as a helper for the Candidate Filtering component, providing a specific rule-check necessary for the filtering logic. Its inclusion is justified as it directly supports the core filtering responsibility, embodying a granular, reusable validation within the subsystem.
