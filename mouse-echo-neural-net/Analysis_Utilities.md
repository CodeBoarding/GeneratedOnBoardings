Component Overview: Analysis Utilities

### Analysis Utilities [[Expand]](./Analysis_Utilities.md)
This component serves as a foundational utility layer, providing a shared collection of specialized helper functions and algorithms. Its primary purpose is to support general image manipulation, analysis, and data handling, with specific functionalities tailored for both B-mode and M-mode processing. It acts as a common toolkit that the respective Analysis Cores (B-mode and M-mode) leverage for their specialized operations. This aligns with a Layered Architecture pattern, where common utilities are abstracted into a dedicated layer.
