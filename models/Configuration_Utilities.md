## Details

The core of this subsystem revolves around `ParamsDict`, which acts as the central configuration manager for the entire project. `ParamsDict` provides a standardized and validated interface for handling model hyperparameters and training configurations. Both `Model Implementations`, which define the neural network architectures, and the `Training and Evaluation Framework`, responsible for orchestrating the learning process, critically depend on `ParamsDict` to retrieve their operational settings. This design ensures consistency, reproducibility, and ease of management for all configurable aspects of the models and their training lifecycle.

### ParamsDict
A central component providing a robust, dictionary-like interface for managing model hyperparameters and configurations. It is responsible for parsing, validating, and overriding parameters, ensuring consistent and well-defined settings across various model implementations and training processes.
