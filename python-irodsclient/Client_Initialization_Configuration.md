## Details

The iRODS client initialization subsystem is orchestrated by the `Client Initialization & Configuration Orchestrator`, which serves as the central control point for establishing an iRODS session. This orchestrator relies on the `Client Configuration Manager` to load and manage client-specific settings, ensuring the client is properly configured for connection. Concurrently, the `Authentication File Manager` handles the secure creation and encoding of authentication credentials, which are vital for user verification. All necessary user and connection details are structured and provided by the `Account Data Model`. This integrated approach ensures a robust and secure initialization process, preparing the client for seamless interaction with the iRODS server.

### Client Initialization & Configuration Orchestrator
This component acts as the central coordinator for the subsystem. It orchestrates the loading of client configurations, manages the authentication file lifecycle, and prepares the iRODS account details for session establishment. It is crucial for initiating any client-server interaction.
