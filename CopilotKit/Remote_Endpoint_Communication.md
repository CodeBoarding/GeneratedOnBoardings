## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Remote Endpoint Communication [[Expand]](./Remote_Endpoint_Communication.md)
This component is the backbone for all network-level interactions within the SDK. It manages the secure and efficient exchange of data, including API requests, responses, and the necessary serialization/deserialization processes, between the SDK and external CopilotKit services or various AI providers. Its primary role is to ensure reliable and structured communication with remote endpoints.
