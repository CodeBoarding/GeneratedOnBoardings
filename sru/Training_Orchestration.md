## Details

This subsystem focuses on the training and evaluation of various natural language processing (NLP) models, including text classification, DrQA, and generic language models. It is structured around several orchestrator components that manage the end-to-end training pipelines and a set of core components that provide specialized functionalities. The orchestrators delegate tasks such as data handling, model creation, training execution, and performance evaluation to these core components. The core components, primarily found within the `sru` package, encapsulate the fundamental operations of recurrent neural networks, including data processing, model architecture definition, and the core training recurrence.

### Classification Training Orchestrator
