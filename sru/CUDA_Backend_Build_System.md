## Details

The `sru` project's core architecture centers on the efficient integration of high-performance CUDA kernels with the PyTorch framework. The `Build System Orchestrator`, primarily represented by `setup.py`, manages the entire build lifecycle, from issuing compilation directives to the `CUDA Kernel Implementations` (located in `sru/csrc`) to integrating the resulting compiled artifacts. In turn, the `CUDA Kernel Implementations` provide the optimized computational logic, packaged as compiled artifacts, back to the `Build System Orchestrator` for seamless consumption within the Python/PyTorch environment. This bidirectional interaction ensures that the low-level, GPU-accelerated operations are correctly built and made available to the higher-level deep learning library.

### Build System Orchestrator
This component is responsible for managing the entire compilation and linking process of the custom CUDA kernels. It defines how the C++ and CUDA source files in `sru/csrc` are compiled into a Python-loadable shared library, ensuring seamless integration with the PyTorch environment. It leverages tools like Ninja (as indicated by the project's tech stack) to achieve efficient builds. This component is fundamental for a Deep Learning Library as it bridges the gap between high-performance C++/CUDA code and the Python/PyTorch ecosystem.

### CUDA Kernel Implementations
This component houses the highly optimized, low-level SRU recurrence logic written in C++ and CUDA. These kernels are the computational backbone, performing the actual high-performance operations directly on the GPU. They are designed for maximum efficiency and are the core of the performance optimization pattern, which is a key architectural bias for this project. This component is central to a Deep Learning Library for delivering the performance gains expected from custom hardware-accelerated operations.
