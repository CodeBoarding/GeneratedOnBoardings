## Details

The `cogdl` project's core architecture for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph embeddings is structured around a set of abstract and foundational components. `BaseGNNModel` serves as the abstract base for all GNN implementations, ensuring a consistent interface for message passing and aggregation, and it leverages `GNNLayers` as modular building blocks for various GNN architectures. `AutoGNN` acts as an orchestrator, dynamically constructing and combining GNN models, showcasing the project's automated model design capabilities. Beyond GNNs, the system also integrates graph embedding algorithms like `DeepWalk` and `SDNE`, which focus on learning low-dimensional node representations. Furthermore, the `OAGBert` and `BertModel` components highlight the project's specialized integration of BERT for academic graph data, with `OAGBert` managing the interaction with the core `BertModel`.

### BaseGNNModel
Serves as the foundational abstract class for various GNNs, defining the common interface and core logic for message passing and aggregation. It is fundamental for establishing a consistent structure across different GNN implementations.

### GNNLayers
Provides atomic, reusable neural network layers (e.g., `gcn_layer`, `gat_layer`, `sage_layer`) that are building blocks for constructing GNN models within `cogdl.models.nn`. This component promotes modularity and reusability in GNN design.
