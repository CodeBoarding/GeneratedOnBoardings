## Details

The `Re-ID Feature Extraction Unit` subsystem is a critical part of the overall object tracking pipeline, specifically designed to generate unique appearance descriptors for detected objects.

### FeatureExtractor
This is the primary orchestrator of the feature extraction process. It is responsible for loading and managing the pre-trained re-identification neural network model. Its `__call__` method serves as the main interface for external modules to request feature extraction from input image crops.

### _preprocess
A crucial internal helper method within the `FeatureExtractor`'s operational flow. Its responsibility is to prepare raw input image data (cropped bounding boxes) by performing necessary transformations such as resizing, normalization, and conversion into a tensor format compatible with the re-identification model. This ensures the data is in the correct format and range for the neural network.

### _resize
A specialized utility function/method, typically invoked by `_preprocess`, dedicated to resizing image data to the specific dimensions required by the feature extraction model. This ensures consistent input shape for the neural network, which is vital for correct model inference.
