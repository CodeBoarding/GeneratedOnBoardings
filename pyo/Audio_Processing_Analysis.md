## Details

The `Audio Processing & Analysis` subsystem in `pyo` is a core set of modules dedicated to transforming, manipulating, and extracting information from audio signals. It embodies the project's signal-flow architectural bias, where audio and control data move through various processing stages.

### pyo.lib.players
Acts as an audio source, playing back audio from files or internal tables, initiating the audio signal flow within the subsystem.

### pyo.lib.effects
Applies various general audio effects (e.g., distortion, delay, reverb) to incoming signals, altering their sonic characteristics.
