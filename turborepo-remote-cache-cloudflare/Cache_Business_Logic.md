## Details

The component analysis cannot be fully updated with concrete and verifiable source file references due to the project being primarily written in TypeScript (.ts files). The available tools are limited to reading Python, Markdown, Text, reStructuredText, and YAML files, which prevents direct access to the TypeScript source code for detailed analysis and reference. Therefore, the original analysis is returned unchanged, with the acknowledgment of the limitation in providing direct source code references for TypeScript files.
