## Details

The `diffrax` library is designed around a modular architecture for solving differential equations. The `Integration Engine` acts as the central orchestrator, managing the overall integration process and event handling. It interacts with the `Problem Definition` component to understand the mathematical structure of the differential equation. The core numerical computations are performed by the `Numerical Solvers`, which approximate the solution step-by-step and can utilize `Stochastic Path Generation` for stochastic differential equations. The `Solution Management` component is responsible for handling, storing, and presenting the computed results. Finally, the `Adjoint Computation` component provides crucial functionality for gradient calculations, enabling optimization and machine learning applications. This clear separation of concerns facilitates both maintainability and extensibility, making it suitable for generating comprehensive data flow diagrams.
