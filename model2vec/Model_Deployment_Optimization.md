## Details

The `model2vec` subsystem is designed for streamlined model deployment and inference. It comprises three key components: `Model Optimization (Quantization)`, which prepares models for efficient execution; `Model Inference Core`, which manages and performs the actual predictions using these optimized models; and `Model Export Utility`, which facilitates the conversion of models from the inference core into various deployable formats. This architecture ensures that models are optimized for performance, efficiently executed, and readily adaptable for diverse deployment environments.

### Model Inference Core
This component serves as the central hub for managing and executing model inference. It handles loading pre-trained models, performing predictions, and evaluating model performance. It provides the primary API for users to interact with trained models for real-world applications.

### Model Optimization (Quantization)
This component focuses on enhancing model efficiency and reducing resource consumption. It specifically implements quantization techniques to optimize models for faster inference and smaller memory footprint, preparing them for efficient deployment.
