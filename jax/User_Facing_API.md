## Details

The JAX architecture is centered around its **Core Transformations**, which enable just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation, vectorization, and parallelization of Python functions. These transformations heavily **leverage** the **XLA Backend & Compilation** component, responsible for compiling and optimizing operations for various hardware accelerators and dispatching them for execution. The **Automatic Differentiation Engine** is a core utility **utilized** by the transformation system to enable gradient computations. High-level numerical operations, including **NumPy-like Operations**, **SciPy-like Operations**, and **Neural Network Functions**, are built on top of JAX's core. The **NumPy-Lax Bridge** plays a crucial role by **translating** these high-level array operations into JAX's internal `lax` primitives, which are then processed by the XLA backend. All operations **rely on** the **Data Type Management** component for consistent and efficient handling of numerical data types across the system.

### Core Transformations
This component provides the fundamental JAX transformations such as `jit` (just-in-time compilation), `grad` (automatic differentiation), `vmap` (vectorization), and `pmap` (parallelization). It acts as the orchestrator for applying these transformations to user-defined functions.
