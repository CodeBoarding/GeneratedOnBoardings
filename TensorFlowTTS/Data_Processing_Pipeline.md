## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Preprocessing Orchestrator
The primary entry point for the data preparation workflow. It parses configuration (e.g., dataset name, paths), selects and instantiates the appropriate Concrete Processor, and drives the overall preprocessing execution.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `tensorflow_tts/bin/preprocess.py`


### Processor Interface
An abstract base class (BaseProcessor) that defines the standard contract for all data processors. It establishes the sequence of operations (the "template method") for converting raw data into features, such as loading text, cleaning text, and saving outputs.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `tensorflow_tts/processor/base_processor.py`


### Concrete Processors
A collection of dataset-specific classes that implement the Processor Interface. Each class provides the concrete logic for handling a specific dataset's format, such as LJSpeech, Baker, or KSS. They function as plugins to the main orchestrator.

- `tensorflow_tts/processor/baker.py`
- `tensorflow_tts/processor/kss.py`
