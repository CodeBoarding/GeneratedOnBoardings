## Details

The `qlib` workflow subsystem is designed to manage the lifecycle of quantitative research experiments and online trading operations. The `Exp` component acts as a high-level entry point, abstracting interactions with the core `ExperimentManager` and `Recorder` components. `ExperimentManager` is responsible for orchestrating experiment runs, while `Recorder` handles the persistence of experiment artifacts. For task-driven workflows, `TaskGenerator` creates individual tasks that are then managed and executed by `TaskManager`. In the context of online operations, `OnlineManager` coordinates the entire process, leveraging `Operator` for execution and `OnlineUpdater` for continuous model and prediction updates. This modular design ensures clear separation of concerns and facilitates efficient management of complex quantitative workflows.

### ExperimentManager
The central orchestrator for managing the lifecycle of experiments. It handles the creation, initiation, termination, searching, and listing of experiment runs, ensuring reproducibility and tracking in quantitative research.

### Recorder
Manages the persistence and retrieval of experiment-related artifacts, parameters, and metrics. It ensures that all outputs and configurations of an experiment run are properly saved and can be reloaded for analysis or further use.

### Exp
Serves as a high-level, user-facing facade for experiment management. It simplifies interactions with `ExperimentManager` and `Recorder`, providing a more abstract interface for users to define and run experiments.
