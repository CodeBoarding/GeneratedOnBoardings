## Component Details

The Code Transformation Engine is responsible for taking chat messages, parsing them as code diffs, and applying those diffs to a virtual file system represented by a FilesDict. This process allows the system to modify and update code based on instructions received in a chat format, effectively enabling AI-driven code changes.

### ChatToFiles
The ChatToFiles component orchestrates the conversion of chat messages into a structured file system representation. It receives chat input, parses it for code diffs, and applies these diffs to a FilesDict, effectively translating natural language instructions into code modifications.

### FilesDict
The FilesDict component acts as an in-memory file system, storing and managing file content. It provides an interface for reading, writing, and modifying files, allowing the system to apply code changes and maintain a consistent representation of the codebase.

### Diff
The Diff component represents a set of changes to be applied to a file. It contains one or more Hunks, each representing a contiguous block of changes. The Diff component is responsible for parsing, validating, and applying these changes to the FilesDict.
