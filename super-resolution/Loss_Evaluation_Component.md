## Details

The super-resolution system is structured around a training pipeline focused on optimizing a generator network. The Generator Loss Calculator acts as the primary orchestrator for generator training, aggregating various loss components: Content Loss Calculator for pixel/feature fidelity, Discriminator Loss Calculator for adversarial training, and Perceptual Feature Extractor (VGG-22) and Perceptual Feature Extractor (VGG-54) for perceptual quality. Post-training or during evaluation, the Model Evaluator component takes charge, leveraging the PSNR Metric Calculator to quantitatively assess the super-resolution model's performance. This modular design clearly separates the training loss computation from the model evaluation process.

### Generator Loss Calculator
Computes the comprehensive loss for the generator network, typically combining content, adversarial, and perceptual loss components to guide the generator's optimization.

### Content Loss Calculator
Calculates the content-based loss, which measures the pixel-wise or feature-wise difference between the generated low-resolution image and the target high-resolution image.

### Discriminator Loss Calculator
Determines the loss for the discriminator network, which is trained to distinguish between real high-resolution images and generated super-resolution images.

### Perceptual Feature Extractor (VGG-22)
Utilizes a pre-trained VGG-19 network (up to layer 'block3_conv4') to extract features from images, which are then used to compute the perceptual loss, focusing on texture and style.

### Perceptual Feature Extractor (VGG-54)
Employs a deeper part of the pre-trained VGG-19 network (up to layer 'block5_conv4') to extract more abstract features for perceptual loss, capturing higher-level semantic differences.

### Model Evaluator
Orchestrates the quantitative assessment of the super-resolution model's performance, typically by invoking various metric calculation functions.

### PSNR Metric Calculator
Computes the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), a widely used objective metric for evaluating the quality of reconstructed images by comparing them to a reference image.
