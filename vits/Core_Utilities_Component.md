## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Core Utilities Component [[Expand]](./Core_Utilities_Component.md)
This component provides foundational, shared functionalities and performance-critical operations utilized across all other components of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. It encompasses general utility functions, common data manipulations, and specialized modules for performance optimization, particularly in areas like monotonic alignment and custom text cleaning. Its design emphasizes reusability and efficiency, serving as a bedrock for various system operations.
