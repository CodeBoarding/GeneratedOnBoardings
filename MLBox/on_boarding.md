## Details

The MLBox architecture is designed as a streamlined machine learning pipeline, commencing with the Data Preparation component, which ingests and transforms raw data into a usable format. This prepared data is then channeled to the Model Training component for individual model development and to the Ensemble & Stacking component for advanced model combination. The Hyperparameter Optimization component iteratively refines the parameters for both base and ensemble models, enhancing their predictive power. Ultimately, the Prediction & Evaluation component receives the processed data from Data Preparation and the trained models from Model Training and Ensemble & Stacking to generate final predictions and comprehensive performance reports, completing the end-to-end machine learning workflow.
