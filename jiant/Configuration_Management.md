## Details

The `Configuration Management` subsystem is the central hub for all experiment parameters within the `jiant` project. It is responsible for parsing, validating, and distributing configurations, acting as the single source of truth that drives the behavior of other components, aligning with the "Configuration-Driven Architecture" and "Configurability as a First-Class Citizen" patterns.

### Configuration Core
This component serves as the foundational utility layer for handling raw configuration data. It provides robust mechanisms for parsing, loading, merging, and serializing configuration from various sources (e.g., command-line arguments, JSON files). It ensures the integrity and consistency of the base configuration. This component is fundamental as it provides the low-level, generic configuration capabilities required by any configuration-driven system.

### Experiment Configurator
This is the high-level orchestrator for defining and preparing the overall experiment configuration. It takes the raw configuration, applies experiment-specific adjustments (e.g., capping examples, parsing task lists), and performs crucial validation checks. This component embodies the "Configurability as a First-Class Citizen" principle, as it shapes the entire experiment's behavior, which is critical for an "Experiment-Centric" ML toolkit.

### Task Container Setup
This component specializes the general experiment configuration into concrete, task-specific data structures and parameters. It is responsible for creating `JiantTaskContainer` instances, which are essential for individual NLP tasks within the `jiant` framework. This ensures that the configuration is correctly interpreted and applied for specific data processing and model execution, bridging the gap between general experiment settings and task-specific requirements.
