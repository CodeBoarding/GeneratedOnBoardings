## Details

The `Base Component Framework` subsystem establishes the foundational structure for all pluggable NLP modules within HanLP, ensuring a consistent interface and lifecycle management through an inheritance hierarchy.

### Component
This is the foundational abstract base class for all NLP components in HanLP. It defines the essential lifecycle methods (e.g., `__init__`, `predict`, `train`, `save`, `load`) and a consistent interface that all concrete components must adhere to, regardless of their underlying deep learning framework. It acts as the blueprint for any pluggable NLP module.

### TorchComponent
A concrete implementation of the `Component` interface specifically tailored for PyTorch-based NLP models. It extends the base component's lifecycle management to include PyTorch-specific concerns such as device management (CPU/GPU), model serialization/deserialization using PyTorch's mechanisms, and integration with PyTorch's training loop.

### KerasComponent
A concrete implementation of the `Component` interface designed for Keras/TensorFlow 2.x-based NLP models. Similar to `TorchComponent`, it adapts the generic component lifecycle to the specifics of Keras models, including graph management, session handling (if applicable in older Keras versions, or TensorFlow's eager execution), and TensorFlow-specific persistence mechanisms.
