## Component Details

The Ad Object Management component provides a structured way to interact with Facebook's advertising platform. It defines classes representing key ad objects like Ads, Ad Accounts, Ad Sets, Campaigns, and Ad Creatives. These classes inherit from base classes that handle API communication and data manipulation, offering a consistent interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting ad objects. The component simplifies ad campaign management by encapsulating the complexities of the Facebook Ads API.
