## Component Details

The Device Management & Control component in uiautomator2 provides functionalities for managing and controlling an Android device's software environment. It encompasses application management (installing, uninstalling, starting, and stopping apps) and input method management (setting the current IME and sending text input). The central flow involves the `_Device` class, which integrates `AppMixIn` and `InputMethodMixIn` to offer a unified interface for interacting with the device. Users can control the device's software configuration and behavior through this component.

### AppMixIn
