## Component Details

The Reporting & Configuration Management subsystem in uiautomator2 provides functionalities for generating HTML reports of test executions and managing the library's settings. The HTMLReport component creates detailed reports with screenshots, while the Settings component allows users to customize the library's behavior. These components interact with the device through the _Device and _BaseClient components, which handle communication and device interactions. The Session component initializes the connection and sets up the environment. The SimpleHTTPServer serves the generated reports for easy access.

### HTMLReport
The HTMLReport class is responsible for generating HTML reports of UI automation test runs. It records screenshots and adds steps to the report, and it can patch and unpatch click events to track user interactions. It uses a simple HTTP server to serve the generated report.
