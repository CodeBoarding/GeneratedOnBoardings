## Component Details

This graph illustrates the architecture of the Object Detection & Tracking subsystem, which is responsible for identifying and tracking various objects within video streams. The main flow involves leveraging different detection mechanisms, such as Haar Cascades and Deep Neural Networks, to initially locate objects, followed by employing a tracking algorithm like KCF to maintain continuous surveillance of these objects across frames. Its purpose is to provide a flexible and robust framework for real-time object analysis in video applications.
