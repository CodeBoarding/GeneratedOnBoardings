## Component Details

The `opencv-python` library provides Python bindings for the OpenCV C++ library, enabling a wide range of computer vision and image processing functionalities. The core flow involves reading image or video data, performing various processing, analysis, or machine learning tasks on this data, and then potentially displaying or saving the results. The library exposes a rich set of functions and classes, primarily through the `cv2` module, allowing for operations from basic image manipulation to advanced object detection and 3D reconstruction.
