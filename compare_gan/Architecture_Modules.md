## Details

The Architecture Modules subsystem is structured around an abstract base (Abstract Architecture) that defines the common interface for all concrete GAN architectures. These concrete architectures (DCGAN Architecture, ResNet BigGAN Architecture, ResNet BigGAN Deep Architecture, SNDCGAN Architecture) inherit from this base, ensuring interchangeability. All concrete architectures heavily rely on shared utility components (Architecture Operations and ResNet Operations) for their fundamental building blocks and specialized ResNet patterns, respectively. This design promotes modularity, reusability, and facilitates rapid experimentation by allowing different architectures to be plugged in and out while leveraging a common set of low-level operations.

### Abstract Architecture
Defines the foundational interface (AbstractArchitecture class with an apply method) that all concrete neural network architectures must implement. This ensures a consistent API for integrating different generator/discriminator models, crucial for the modularity and extensibility of an ML research framework.
