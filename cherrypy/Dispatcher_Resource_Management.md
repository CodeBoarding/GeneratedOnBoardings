## Details

The Dispatcher & Resource Management subsystem in CherryPy is central to its request-response cycle, specifically handling how incoming URLs are translated into executable Python code.

### Dispatcher
This component acts as the Front Controller and Request Dispatcher. It is the central orchestrator for routing incoming HTTP requests. Its primary responsibility is to parse the incoming URL, traverse the application's resource tree, identify the appropriate Python object (resource) and method to handle the request, and then invoke that method. It handles the intricate logic of URL-to-code mapping, argument extraction, and internal redirects.

### Resource Tree Manager
This component functions as the Resource Tree Manager or Application Mount Point Manager. It maintains the hierarchical structure of the web application's resources. Developers use this component to "mount" Python objects (which represent web resources or entire applications) at specific URL paths. It essentially builds and manages the "application tree" that defines how URLs map to Python code, providing the structured lookup mechanism that the Dispatcher utilizes.
