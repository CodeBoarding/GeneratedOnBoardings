## Component Details

The Quantum Chemistry Integration component provides a set of tools for performing quantum chemistry calculations, primarily Density Functional Theory (DFT), and integrating them into machine learning workflows. The central flow involves setting up a molecular system, calculating the Hamiltonian matrix, solving the Kohn-Sham equations self-consistently, and computing molecular properties. This process leverages various sub-components for integral evaluation, exchange-correlation functional implementation, and grid-based numerical integration, ultimately providing accurate molecular features for training machine learning models.

### Mol
Represents a molecule and stores its properties, such as atomic coordinates, basis set, and number of electrons. It is responsible for setting up the integration grid for DFT calculations and loading basis set information.

### HamiltonCGTO
Calculates the Hamiltonian matrix in the contracted Gaussian-type orbital (CGTO) basis. It computes various terms, including kinetic energy, nuclear attraction, electron repulsion, and exchange-correlation potential. It relies on integral calculations and exchange-correlation functional implementations.
