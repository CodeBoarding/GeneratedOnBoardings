## Component Details

The Data Model component in the Discord API represents the structure and organization of Discord's data. It defines how various entities like servers (Guilds), users (Members), channels, messages, and roles are represented and how they relate to each other. This component provides a consistent and intuitive way for developers to interact with Discord's data, enabling them to build applications that can access and manipulate Discord resources effectively. The core of this model revolves around the Guild, which contains Members, Roles, and various types of Channels. Messages are sent within Channels, and can contain Embeds and Files. Reactions are associated with Messages.
