## Details

The `Framework Utilities` component in `synflownet` is a crucial collection of general-purpose utility functions that support various components across the framework. It provides essential functionalities for multiprocessing, inter-process communication, shared memory management, data transformations, device management, RNG seeding, and general data structure manipulation. These components are fundamental because they provide the underlying infrastructure and specialized functionalities required for a research-oriented machine learning application in computational chemistry. They enable efficient data handling, distributed computation, flexible configuration, guided molecule generation, and robust evaluation, all of which are critical for developing and deploying generative models for drug discovery. The modular design of these utilities allows for their reuse across different parts of the framework, promoting maintainability and extensibility.

### Configuration Utilities
This component is responsible for managing configuration settings across the `synflownet` framework, particularly for utility modules. It leverages `StrictDataClass` to ensure strict data validation for configuration objects, promoting robust and reproducible experiments.

### General Utilities
A versatile module containing a collection of general-purpose utility functions and classes. This includes data structure manipulations (e.g., `flat_dict_to_nested_dict`, `nested_dict_to_flat_dict`), and the `StrictDataClass` which serves as a base for many configuration classes across the project, ensuring strict data validation. It's a foundational component used widely throughout the framework.

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC) & Shared Memory
This component provides robust mechanisms for inter-process communication (IPC) and shared memory management. It enables the framework to offload computationally intensive tasks, such as reward calculations, to separate worker processes, crucial for distributed computation and efficient resource utilization.
