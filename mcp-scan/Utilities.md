## Component Details

The Utilities component provides a set of utility functions used throughout the mcp_scan application. These functions encapsulate common tasks such as argument rebalancing, improving code reusability and maintainability. The main flow involves calling these utility functions from various parts of the application to perform specific tasks, such as rebalancing command-line arguments before processing them.

### rebalance_command_args
This function rebalances command-line arguments. It takes a dictionary of arguments as input and rearranges or modifies them based on predefined rules or logic. The rebalancing ensures arguments are in the correct format and order for subsequent processing. This function is crucial for ensuring that the application receives and processes arguments correctly, regardless of the initial order or format.
