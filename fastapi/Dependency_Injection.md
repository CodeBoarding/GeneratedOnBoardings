## Details

Component overview for Dependency Injection in FastAPI

### fastapi.Depends
This is the core dependency injection mechanism. It's a callable that FastAPI uses to resolve dependencies for path operation functions. It handles the execution of dependency functions and the caching of results based on scope.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### fastapi.dependencies.models.Dependant
Represents a collection of dependencies for a specific path operation. It stores information about the dependency functions, their parameters, and how they should be resolved.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### fastapi.params.Param
While primarily for defining request parameters, these classes also play a role in dependency injection. They can be used as type hints in dependency functions, allowing FastAPI to automatically extract and validate request data and inject it into the dependency.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### fastapi.routing.APIRoute
Represents a single route in the API. It uses the Dependant model to resolve dependencies for the route's path operation function.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### fastapi.applications.FastAPI
The main application class. It inherits from APIRouter and is responsible for configuring and managing the API, including setting up the dependency injection system.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
