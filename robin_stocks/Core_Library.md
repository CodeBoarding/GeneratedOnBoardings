## Details

The `Core Library` subsystem is primarily defined by the `robin_stocks` package, serving as the central entry point and facade for the entire library. It orchestrates interactions with various financial API clients. The primary internal relationship within this subsystem is the `Core Library` acting as a central orchestrator that delegates tasks to the specialized functional modules (`Robinhood Functional Modules`, `Gemini Functional Modules`, `TD Ameritrade Functional Modules`). This "utilizes" relationship signifies that the `Core Library` depends on these modules to fulfill specific API requests, while the functional modules provide the concrete implementations for interacting with their respective external financial services. This structure adheres to the Facade and Module/Layered Architecture patterns, promoting clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
