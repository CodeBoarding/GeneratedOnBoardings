## Details

The `CLI Orchestrator` subsystem serves as the primary user interface and high-level workflow initiator for `cibuildwheel`. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and triggering the overall build process, acting as a Facade to the underlying complexities of the build system.

### CLI Entry Point / Facade
This component serves as the primary user interface. Its core responsibility is to parse command-line arguments, initialize the application's environment (e.g., logging), and act as a Facade by initiating the high-level build process without exposing the underlying complexities to the user. It handles the initial setup and delegation.

### Build Workflow Manager
This component orchestrates the core, high-level build process within the specified project directory. It manages the sequence of operations required for a successful build, including setting up the build environment, performing initial pre-build checks, determining the target platform, and coordinating with subsequent, more specialized build stages.

### Pre-Build Information & Validation
Responsible for gathering and printing essential pre-build information to the console, providing immediate feedback to the user about the build context and environment.

### Warning Detector
Identifies and reports potential issues or non-critical warnings related to the build environment or configuration, ensuring the user is aware of any caveats without necessarily halting execution.

### Platform Determiner
Computes and returns the specific platform (e.g., operating system, architecture) on which `cibuildwheel` is currently executing, enabling platform-specific build logic and configuration.
