## Monitor Execution Component Overview

This component focuses on the execution of individual monitors, which perform specific tests and record their results. It manages dependencies between monitors and handles skipping or delaying monitors based on dependencies.

Here's a data flow diagram illustrating the process:

    SimpleMonitor --> Monitor: uses
    Monitor -- runs --> run_test: calls
    run_test -- success --> record_success: calls
    run_test -- failure --> record_fail: calls
    record_success -- updates --> Monitor: updates
    record_fail -- updates --> Monitor: updates
    Monitor -- checks --> dependencies: checks
    dependencies -- determines --> run_test: determines
```

### Component Descriptions:

*   **SimpleMonitor**: Orchestrates the entire monitoring process. It loads the configuration, creates monitor instances, and calls `run_tests` to execute them. It uses the `Monitor` component to perform the actual tests.
    *   Relevant source files: `repos.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.SimpleMonitor`

*   **Monitor**: Abstract base class for all monitors. It defines the interface for running tests (`run_test`), recording results (`record_success`, `record_fail`), and managing dependencies. Concrete monitor classes inherit from this class and implement the `run_test` method to perform specific checks.
    *   Relevant source files: `repos.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.Monitors.monitor.Monitor`

*   **run_test**: This method is implemented by subclasses of `Monitor`. It contains the specific logic for performing the test. It calls `record_success` or `record_fail` based on the test result.
    *   Relevant source files: Example: `repos.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.Monitors.host.MonitorDiskSpace.run_test`

*   **record_success**: Records a successful test result. It updates the monitor's state and logs the success.
    *   Relevant source files: `repos.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.Monitors.monitor.Monitor`

*   **record_fail**: Records a failed test result. It updates the monitor's state, logs the failure, and potentially triggers alerts.
    *   Relevant source files: `repos.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.Monitors.monitor.Monitor`

*   **dependencies**: Represents the dependencies between monitors. The `Monitor` component checks these dependencies before running a test. If a dependency is not met, the test may be skipped or delayed.
    *   Relevant source files: `repos.simplemonitor.simplemonitor.Monitors.monitor.Monitor` (dependency management within the class)
