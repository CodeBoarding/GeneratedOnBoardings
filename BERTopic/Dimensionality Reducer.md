## Component Details

The Dimensionality Reduction subsystem in BERTopic reduces the high-dimensional document embeddings into a lower-dimensional space. This is primarily achieved using UMAP, which preserves the semantic relationships between documents while significantly reducing computational costs for subsequent clustering. The core purpose is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of topic modeling by mitigating the curse of dimensionality and noise inherent in high-dimensional data.

### BERTopic
The main class that encapsulates the entire topic modeling process. It orchestrates the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and topic representation.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `BERTopic.bertopic._bertopic.BERTopic`

### fit
The `fit` method is responsible for training the BERTopic model on a given set of documents. It calls the `_reduce_dimensionality` and `_cluster_embeddings` methods.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `BERTopic.bertopic._bertopic.BERTopic:fit`

### _reduce_dimensionality
This method reduces the dimensionality of the document embeddings using a specified dimensionality reduction technique, typically UMAP. It transforms the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space for efficient clustering.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `BERTopic.bertopic._bertopic.BERTopic:_reduce_dimensionality`

### BaseDimensionalityReduction
An abstract base class that defines the interface for dimensionality reduction techniques. Concrete implementations, such as UMAP, inherit from this class.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `BERTopic.bertopic.dimensionality._base.BaseDimensionalityReduction`

### UMAP
The UMAP class implements the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique. It inherits from `BaseDimensionalityReduction` and uses the `umap-learn` library to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings.
- **Related Classes/Methods**: `BERTopic.bertopic.dimensionality.UMAP`
