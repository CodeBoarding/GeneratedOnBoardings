## Details

Feedback indicates an issue with the source reference for `Component: Preprocessing and Data Handling`, specifically `QName:metric_learn.preprocessor` with `FileRef: None`. My attempt to retrieve source code using `getSourceCode` for `metric_learn.preprocessor` was unsuccessful, suggesting it might not be a direct code reference but potentially a file or directory. To resolve this, I need to determine if `metric_learn.preprocessor` refers to a file or a directory within the `metric_learn` package. I will use the `getFileStructure` tool to inspect the `metric_learn` directory and identify the correct file path for `preprocessor`. This will ensure accurate source references for both documentation and diagram generation.
