## Details

The lightweight-gan project's core functionality revolves around a training loop that orchestrates model training, evaluation, and performance monitoring. The GAN Model Initializer sets up the generative adversarial network based on configurations managed by the Configuration Manager. During training, the Model State Persistence component handles saving and loading model checkpoints, often interacting with the Checkpoint Selector to manage saved states. For evaluation, the Evaluation Orchestrator generates visual outputs, relying on the Image Generation Core. Concurrently, the Performance Metrics Calculator computes quantitative metrics like FID, also leveraging the Image Generation Core to produce images for analysis. Both evaluation and FID calculation are distinct processes within the main training loop, ensuring comprehensive model assessment.

### Evaluation Orchestrator
Coordinates the overall evaluation of the GAN model's performance, orchestrating the generation of images for visual inspection and tracking.
