## Details

The `lightweight-gan` architecture is designed as a streamlined ML toolkit, centered around a `Training Orchestrator` that drives the entire GAN training and evaluation process. User interaction begins with the `CLI Interface`, which configures and launches the `Training Orchestrator`. Data flows through a `Data Pipeline` that handles loading and augmentation before being fed into the `GAN Model Core`, where the Generator and Discriminator models learn. The `Training Orchestrator` periodically leverages the `Evaluation & Persistence` component for performance assessment, synthetic image generation, and checkpoint management. All critical training metrics and progress are logged via the `Experiment Tracking` component, providing comprehensive insights into experiment runs. This modular design facilitates clear data and control flow, making it ideal for visual representation in a flow graph diagram.
