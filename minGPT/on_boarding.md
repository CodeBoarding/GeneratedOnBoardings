## Details

The minGPT architecture is structured as a clear, modular pipeline for building and training Generative Pre-trained Transformer models, emphasizing simplicity and interpretability. At its foundation, the Configuration Management component centralizes all settings, providing essential parameters to the GPT Model Core, Training Orchestration, and various Project Applications. Data flows through the Data Processing & Tokenization component, which prepares raw text into numerical sequences for the GPT Model Core and handles decoding of its outputs. The Training Orchestration component manages the entire training lifecycle, leveraging configurations and training the GPT Model Core. Finally, Project Applications serve as concrete examples or specific tasks, orchestrating the training process by initiating Training Orchestration, defining custom callbacks, and utilizing the Data Processing & Tokenization for their specific datasets, thereby showcasing the library's reusability and extensibility.

### Configuration Management
Centralized component responsible for defining, loading, and providing configuration settings for models, training, and project-specific parameters. It ensures consistency and reusability of configurations across the system.

### GPT Model Core [[Expand]](./GPT_Model_Core.md)
Encapsulates the fundamental Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture, including its layers, attention mechanisms, and forward pass logic. This is the central intellectual property of the library, designed for clarity and interpretability.

### Training Orchestration
Manages the entire training lifecycle, including iterating over data, performing optimization steps, and executing various callbacks at different stages. It provides a structured pipeline for training, promoting modularity by separating training logic from the model definition.
