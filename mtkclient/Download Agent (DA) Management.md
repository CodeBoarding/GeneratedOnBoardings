## Component Details

This graph illustrates the architecture of the mtkclient application, focusing on its core functionalities for interacting with MediaTek devices. The main flow involves the GUI Layer initiating operations, which are then handled by the Application Core. The Application Core dispatches commands to the MTK Device Interface, which in turn interacts with the Download Agent Management component for complex device operations and the Hardware Communication Layer for low-level serial communication. Various protocol handlers (XML, XFlash, Legacy) are utilized by the Download Agent Management, while a dedicated DA Operation Handler abstracts DA-specific tasks. Configuration and shared utilities provide essential services across the application.

### GUI Layer
This component is responsible for managing the graphical user interface, handling user interactions, and displaying device information and operation progress. It acts as the visual front-end of the mtkclient application.
