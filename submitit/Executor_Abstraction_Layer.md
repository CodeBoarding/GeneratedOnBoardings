## Details

The `submitit` core architecture is centered around the `Executor` component, which serves as a high-level facade for job submission and management. This `Executor` relies heavily on the `plugins` module to dynamically discover and integrate various backend implementations. The `plugins` module acts as a central registry, enabling the `Executor` to abstract away the complexities of different execution environments (e.g., local, Slurm) and maintain a consistent user interface. This design promotes extensibility, allowing new execution backends to be seamlessly added without altering the core `Executor` interface.

### submitit.core.core.Executor
This component acts as the primary user-facing Facade and Executor Interface for the `submitit` library. It offers a high-level, unified API that abstracts the complexities of different job execution backends (e.g., local, Slurm). Its core responsibility is to provide methods for submitting computational jobs, monitoring their progress, and retrieving their results, ensuring a consistent interaction model for users regardless of the underlying execution environment.

### submitit.core.plugins
This module implements the Plugin System and Backend Discovery Mechanism for the `Executor Abstraction Layer`. Its main responsibility is to enable the dynamic registration, discovery, and retrieval of various executor implementations and job environments. This facilitates the system's extensibility and pluggability, allowing new execution backends to be seamlessly integrated without modifying the core `Executor` interface. It acts as a registry for available backend types.
