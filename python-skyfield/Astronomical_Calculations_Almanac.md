## Details

The `skyfield` subsystem is designed around a core set of astronomical calculation and data management capabilities. The `Almanac Calculator` serves as a central computational engine, responsible for determining precise astronomical event times and object properties. It relies heavily on the `Star Data Manager` for accessing and processing fundamental star data, which is crucial for many calculations. Specialized components like the `Magnitude Calculator` and `Eclipse Calculator` extend these capabilities; the `Magnitude Calculator` also utilizes the `Star Data Manager` for relevant star properties, while the `Eclipse Calculator` depends on the `Almanac Calculator` for accurate positional and event data necessary for eclipse computations. Furthermore, the `Constellation Data Provider` integrates with the `Almanac Calculator` to obtain celestial coordinates, enabling it to identify the constellation for a given point in the sky. This architecture establishes a clear flow where data is managed, core calculations are performed, and specialized services build upon these foundational computational and data-providing components.

### Almanac Calculator
This component serves as the core computational engine for determining precise times of astronomical events (like risings, settings, transits) and calculating properties such as the illuminated fraction and phase angle of celestial objects. It acts as the primary interface for event-driven astronomical queries.
