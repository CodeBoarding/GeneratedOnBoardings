## Details

The OpenTelemetry architecture is structured around a clear separation of concerns, enabling flexible and extensible observability. The `OpenTelemetry API` provides a consistent, vendor-neutral interface for application instrumentation, allowing developers to generate traces, metrics, and logs without coupling to specific backend implementations. The `OpenTelemetry SDK` acts as the core processing engine, taking raw telemetry data from the API, applying configuration-driven logic such as sampling and resource enrichment, and preparing it for export. Various `Exporters`, including `OTLP Exporters` for gRPC/HTTP, `Prometheus Exporter` for metrics scraping, and `Zipkin Exporters` for trace collection, handle the transmission of processed telemetry to different observability backends. Furthermore, `Context Propagators` are integral for distributed tracing, ensuring that contextual information like trace IDs and baggage is correctly propagated across service boundaries, enabling end-to-end visibility in complex microservice environments. This modular design facilitates easy integration and adaptability to diverse observability ecosystems.
