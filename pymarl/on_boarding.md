## Details

The `pymarl` project implements a modular and pipeline-driven architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning. At its core, the **Experiment Orchestrator** manages the entire lifecycle, from configuration loading to initiating training and evaluation. It sets up the **Simulation Environment**, which provides the interactive world for agents. The **Agent System** interacts with this environment, generating actions and receiving observations, with its internal models being the primary learnable components. All interactions are logged into the **Experience Replay** buffer, serving as a centralized data source. The **Learning Algorithm** then periodically samples from this buffer to update the **Agent System**'s models, completing the reinforcement learning loop. This design clearly separates concerns into experiment management, environment interaction, data handling, and core learning logic, making it highly adaptable for diverse multi-agent research and development.

### Experiment Orchestrator [[Expand]](./Experiment_Orchestrator.md)
The central control unit responsible for initializing the entire system, loading configurations, and managing the overall training and evaluation lifecycle. It orchestrates the interaction between all other components.

### Simulation Environment [[Expand]](./Simulation_Environment.md)
Simulates the multi-agent world, providing observations to agents, processing their actions, and returning rewards and new states. It acts as the interface to the simulated reality.

### Agent System [[Expand]](./Agent_System.md)
Encapsulates the logic for agents, including their neural network models (policies/critics) and the mechanism for selecting actions based on observations. It represents the learnable entities within the environment.

### Experience Replay [[Expand]](./Experience_Replay.md)
A data store that accumulates experiences (transitions or full episodes) collected from the `Simulation Environment` by the `Agent System`. It enables efficient sampling of past data for the learning process, breaking temporal correlations.

### Learning Algorithm [[Expand]](./Learning_Algorithm.md)
Implements the core reinforcement learning algorithms. It samples data from the `Experience Replay` and uses it to compute updates for the models within the `Agent System`, driving the learning process. This component may also incorporate value mixers for specific multi-agent algorithms.
