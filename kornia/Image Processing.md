## Component Details

The Image Processing component in Kornia provides a comprehensive suite of tools for manipulating and analyzing images represented as PyTorch tensors. It encompasses functionalities for color space conversion, image enhancement, filtering, and morphological operations. The component is designed to be differentiable, enabling its integration into deep learning pipelines for tasks such as image recognition, segmentation, and generation. The core of the component lies in its ability to perform a wide range of image transformations, offering both functional and class-based interfaces for ease of use and flexibility.

### Color Space Conversion
