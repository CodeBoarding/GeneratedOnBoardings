## Details

The UI Builder subsystem provides a comprehensive environment for visual application development. The `UIBuilderApp` acts as the central hub, coordinating various specialized components. The `Canvas/Design Surface` offers the interactive visual workspace, while the `Properties Panel` and `Widget Palette/Library Integration` facilitate widget configuration and selection. Data and event logic are managed through the `Data Binding Editor` and `Action/Event Editor`, respectively, which integrate with external execution engines. All design-time changes are consistently managed by the `Application State Manager`, ensuring a coherent representation of the application. Finally, the `Save/Load Manager` handles the persistence of the entire application definition by interacting with a backend `API Gateway`. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for modular development and efficient management of the UI building process.

### UIBuilderApp
The central orchestrator of the UI building process. It initializes and manages the lifecycle of the design canvas, property panels, and various editors, delegating tasks to specialized internal components.

### Canvas/Design Surface
Renders the visual representation of the application being built, handling drag-and-drop operations, resizing, and positioning of widgets.

### Widget Palette/Library Integration
Displays available widgets from the `Widget/Component Library` and facilitates their selection and addition to the canvas.

### Data Binding Editor
A specialized interface for defining and managing data connections, expressions, and transformations for widgets, interacting with the `Data Binding & Evaluation Engine`.

### Action/Event Editor
An interface for users to define and configure event handlers and custom logic (e.g., JavaScript functions, API calls) triggered by user interactions or system events, interacting with the `Action/Function Execution Service`.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- <a href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/app/client/src/PluginActionEditor/PluginActionEditor.tsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`Action/Event Editor`</a>


### Application State Manager
Manages the real-time state of the application being designed, including widget hierarchy, properties, and data bindings.
