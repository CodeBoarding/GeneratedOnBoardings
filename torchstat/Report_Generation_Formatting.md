## Details

This subsystem is responsible for transforming raw, aggregated statistical data into a user-friendly, structured report. It acts as the final presentation layer of the `torchstat` analysis pipeline, ensuring that complex neural network metrics are digestible and clearly presented.

### ReportFormatter
This is the primary component responsible for orchestrating the final report generation. It takes the processed statistical data (e.g., FLOPs, parameters, memory usage per layer) and structures it into a presentable format, typically a tabular output. Its responsibilities include defining the report layout, column headers, and ensuring overall report coherence and readability for a neural network analysis summary. This component is architecturally central as it defines the user-facing output of the entire analysis pipeline.

### ValueRounder
This is a utility component dedicated to numerical formatting within the report generation process. Its role is to ensure consistency and readability of numerical data by rounding values to a specified precision. This is crucial for presenting clean, digestible statistical metrics in an ML toolkit, preventing overly long or imprecise numbers from cluttering the report. It supports the `ReportFormatter` by preparing numerical data for display.
