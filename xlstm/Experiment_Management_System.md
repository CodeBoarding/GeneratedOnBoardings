## Details

The `Experiment Management System` subsystem is primarily defined by the `experiments` package, specifically encompassing the functionalities implemented in `experiments/main.py` and `experiments/lr_scheduler.py`. This subsystem is responsible for orchestrating the training and evaluation lifecycle of machine learning models within the xLSTM project.

### ExperimentRunner
This component orchestrates the entire lifecycle of a single experiment run. It handles the initialization of the model, data loaders, optimizers, and the training loop. It also manages evaluation, logging, and checkpointing.

### LearningRateScheduler
This component provides mechanisms for dynamically adjusting the learning rate of an optimizer during the training process. It encapsulates various scheduling strategies.
