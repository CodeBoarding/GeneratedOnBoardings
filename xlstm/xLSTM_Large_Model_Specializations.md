## Details

The xLSTM large model architecture is orchestrated by `xLSTMLargeModel`, which primarily composes an `xLSTMLargeBlockStack`. This stack is responsible for managing a sequence of `mLSTMBlock` instances, forming the core layered structure of the model. Each `mLSTMBlock` further encapsulates an `mLSTMLayer` for recurrent computations and a `FeedForward` network for non-linear transformations. Auxiliary components like `LargeModelComponents` provide fundamental operations such as normalization, while `WeightUtilities` handle efficient weight management. `mLSTMLayerConfig` defines the configurable parameters for the mLSTM layers, ensuring flexible model construction. This nested composition ensures a modular and scalable design for the large xLSTM model.

### xLSTMLargeModel
Acts as the primary orchestrator for the large xLSTM model, managing its construction, forward pass, and generation. It composes `xLSTMLargeBlockStack` to form the complete model architecture. This is the top-level entry point for users to interact with the large xLSTM model.

### xLSTMLargeBlockStack
Manages a sequential stack of xLSTM blocks, representing the layered structure of the large model. It orchestrates the flow of data through multiple computational layers by composing `mLSTMBlock` instances.

### mLSTMLayer
Implements the computational logic for a single mLSTM layer, a fundamental building block of the xLSTM architecture. This is where the core mLSTM operations are performed, often utilizing `LargeModelComponents` for optimized operations.
