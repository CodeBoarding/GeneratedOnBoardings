## Details

The `hiddenlayer` subsystem is designed to abstract and visualize neural network computational graphs. Its central component is the `Graph` class, which encapsulates the network's structure using `Node` and `Edge` objects. The `build_graph` function serves as the primary entry point, responsible for parsing external machine learning models (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and transforming them into this internal `Graph` representation, aided by the `detect_framework` utility. Once the graph is built, `add_node` and `add_edge` methods facilitate its programmatic construction. For visualization, the `build_dot` function converts the `Graph` into a Graphviz DOT format, enabling external rendering. This architecture provides a clear separation between model parsing, graph representation, and visualization concerns.

### Graph
The central data structure (hiddenlayer.graph.Graph) that holds the neural network graph. It acts as the primary container for Node and Edge objects, providing the fundamental API for graph manipulation.

### Node
Represents a single operation, layer, or tensor within the computational graph. These are the vertices of the graph.

### Edge
Represents the data flow or connection between two Node objects in the graph. These are the directed edges of the graph.

### build_graph
A factory-like function responsible for parsing external ML framework models (e.g., PyTorch nn.Module, TensorFlow tf.keras.Model) and constructing the internal Graph representation. This acts as a "Model Adapter/Parser."

### add_node
A method of the Graph class that facilitates adding a new Node object to the graph.

### add_edge
A method of the Graph class that facilitates adding a new Edge object to the graph, establishing a connection between existing nodes.

### build_dot
Converts the internal Graph representation into a Graphviz DOT language string, which can then be used by visualization tools. This component is part of the "Visualization Renderers" aspect.

### detect_framework
A utility function that identifies the deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras) from which a given model originates. This supports the "Input Abstraction" aspect.
