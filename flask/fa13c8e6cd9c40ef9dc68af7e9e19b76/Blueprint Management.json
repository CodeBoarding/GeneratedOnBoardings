  "description": "The Blueprint Management component in Flask provides a way to organize a Flask application into reusable parts. The core idea is to define blueprints, which are essentially mini-applications that can be registered to a main application. This allows for modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier to manage large applications. The Blueprint class is used to create these blueprints, and the BlueprintSetupState class manages the state during the registration process. URL rules are added to the blueprint, and when the blueprint is registered, these rules are merged into the main application's URL map. This system promotes code reusability and maintainability by allowing developers to define sets of routes, templates, and static files that can be easily reused across different parts of the application or in multiple applications.",
