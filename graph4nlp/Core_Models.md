## Details

The `graph4nlp` project's core architecture for graph-to-sequence and graph-to-tree tasks revolves around two primary orchestrators: `Graph2Seq` and `Graph2Tree`. Both inherit from `Base Models`, establishing a common foundation for graph-based neural network models. `Graph2Seq` leverages `GNN Modules` for graph representation learning and `StdRNNDecoder` for sequence generation, making it suitable for tasks like neural machine translation. Similarly, `Graph2Tree` utilizes `GNN Modules` for graph encoding but employs a `TreeBasedDecoder` to produce structured tree outputs, catering to tasks suchs as semantic parsing. For knowledge graph completion, the `Complex` and `Distmult` models are provided, which delegate their core prediction logic to `ComplExLayer` and `DistMultLayer` respectively. This modular design allows for flexible integration of various GNN encoders and decoders, promoting reusability and extensibility across different graph-based NLP tasks.

### Graph2Seq
Orchestrates the end-to-end Graph-to-Sequence pipeline, managing the flow from input graph processing through graph representation learning to output sequence decoding. It is designed for tasks like Neural Machine Translation or Summarization.
