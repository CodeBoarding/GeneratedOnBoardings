## Details

The `gpfjs` project's user and query management subsystem is designed around a service-oriented architecture, typical for Angular applications. User interface components like `UserProfileComponent`, `SaveQueryComponent`, `LoadQueryComponent`, and `SavedQueriesTableComponent` serve as the entry points for user interaction, delegating complex operations to specialized services. The `QueryService` centralizes all operations related to saved user queries, while `UserPreferencesService` handles user profile settings. Both these domain-specific services depend on the `AuthService` to ensure authenticated access to backend resources and leverage the `StateService` for managing application-wide persistent data. All external communication with the backend is abstracted through the `HttpClient`, and `LocalStorageService` provides client-side data persistence, particularly for authentication tokens managed by the `AuthService`. This structure promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability by clearly defining responsibilities and interaction patterns.
