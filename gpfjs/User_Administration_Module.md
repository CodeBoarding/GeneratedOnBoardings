## Details

The User & Administration Module acts as the primary entry point for managing user and administrative functions within the application. It encompasses the UserManagementComponent, which serves as the user interface for administrative tasks, and various services that handle the underlying data and business logic. The UserManagementComponent interacts with both the UsersService for general user data management and the UsersGroupsService for handling user-to-group assignments. The UsersService further leverages the UsersGroupsService for comprehensive user and group management. Additionally, the GroupsTableComponent directly consumes the UsersGroupsService to display and manage group-related information. The FederationCredentialsComponent operates as a specialized administrative component, focusing on external authentication settings. This architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns, with components handling UI and services managing data and business logic, all coordinated by the central User & Administration Module.
