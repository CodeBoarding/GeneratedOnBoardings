## Details

The Benedict Core subsystem is centered around the `Benedict` component, which acts as the primary interface for advanced dictionary operations. `Benedict` directly inherits from `BaseDict`, leveraging its foundational dictionary-like behaviors and core functionalities. This inheritance establishes a clear hierarchical relationship where `BaseDict` provides the essential building blocks and common dictionary mechanics, enabling `Benedict` to extend and enhance these capabilities with specialized data manipulation and access features. This architecture ensures a robust and extensible design, with `Benedict` serving as the facade for users interacting with the library's enriched dictionary structures.

### Benedict
This is the central and primary interface of the Benedict Core subsystem. It extends Python's built-in `dict` functionality, acting as a facade for advanced data manipulation and access. It embodies the "Extension/Decorator" and "Facade" patterns, providing a rich set of methods for deep operations (e.g., `deepcopy`, `deepupdate`), flexible data access (`get`, `set`), and transformation (`groupby`). It serves as the main entry point for users interacting with the library's core data structures.

### BaseDict
This component serves as the foundational base class for `benedict.dicts.Benedict`. It provides the common dictionary-like behaviors and abstracts core functionalities, such as basic initialization (`__init__`), item setting (`__setitem__`), and default value handling (`setdefault`, `update`). It represents the fundamental building block upon which `Benedict`'s enhanced features are built, ensuring a consistent and robust base for all extended dictionary operations.
