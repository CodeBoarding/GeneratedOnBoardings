## Details

This subsystem focuses on the client-side routing mechanism within an Angular application. The Router service interprets URL changes and determines which Component should be displayed. The RouterOutlet acts as a dynamic placeholder within a Template, where the Component selected by the Router is rendered. This interaction ensures a seamless single-page application experience by dynamically updating the view without full page reloads.

### RouterOutlet [[Expand]](./RouterOutlet.md)
A structural directive that serves as a placeholder in a component's template. It dynamically renders the Component associated with the active route, managing its lifecycle.
