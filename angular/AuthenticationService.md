## Details

The authentication subsystem orchestrates user login, logout, and session management. UI Components initiate authentication requests by interacting with the AuthenticationService. The AuthenticationService then communicates with the Backend API to validate credentials and receive authentication tokens. Upon successful authentication, the AuthenticationService updates the State Management component, which holds the global authentication state. UI Components subscribe to State Management to dynamically update their display based on the user's authentication status. The Routing component also queries State Management to protect routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific parts of the application, and redirects users appropriately after login or logout.

### AuthenticationService [[Expand]](./AuthenticationService.md)
