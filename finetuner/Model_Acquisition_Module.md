## Details

The `Model Acquisition Module` provides a high-level abstraction for retrieving machine learning models. At its core, the `Model Orchestrator` (`finetuner.__init__.get_model`) acts as the central control point, receiving model acquisition requests. Based on the artifact type, it intelligently delegates the task. For models hosted on Hugging Face, the `Model Orchestrator` invokes the `Hugging Face Downloader` (`finetuner.__init__._download_huggingface_model`) to handle the specific download and preparation process. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for easy integration of new model sources while maintaining a unified acquisition interface.

### Model Acquisition Module [[Expand]](./Model_Acquisition_Module.md)
This is the overarching conceptual module responsible for providing a unified and abstracted interface for acquiring and loading pre-trained base models. In an ML Toolkit/Library, this component is fundamentally important as it enables users to easily integrate diverse models without needing to understand the underlying acquisition mechanisms. It embodies the "Abstraction" and "Modular Design" architectural patterns. Its functionality is primarily realized through the `Model Orchestrator` and `Hugging Face Downloader` components.

### Model Orchestrator
This component serves as the primary entry point and intelligent orchestrator for all model acquisition requests within the module. It analyzes the requested model identifier or source and dispatches the request to the appropriate specialized downloader or loader. Its architectural importance lies in centralizing the model acquisition logic, enabling extensibility for new model sources, and acting as the main public interface for model retrieval.

### Hugging Face Downloader
This specialized internal component is responsible for the concrete implementation of downloading models specifically from the Hugging Face model hub. It encapsulates all the necessary logic for interacting with Hugging Face APIs, handling authentication, model versioning, and efficient file transfer. Its architectural significance is in providing a clear "Separation of Concerns" for integrating with a major external ML model repository.
