## Details

The core of this subsystem facilitates high-performance input mutation for fuzzing by integrating Python-based fuzzing logic with native C++ mutation capabilities. The `Python-Native Bridge` acts as the primary interface, enabling Python components to invoke the `Native Input Mutator` and supply input data. The `Native Input Mutator` then applies sophisticated mutation strategies using `libprotobuf-mutator` and returns the generated mutated output back to the `Python-Native Bridge`, ensuring efficient and diverse input generation for fuzzing campaigns. This clear separation of concerns allows for optimized performance at the native level while maintaining flexibility and ease of use within the Python fuzzing harness.

### Native Input Mutator
This component encapsulates the core logic for performing sophisticated input mutations at the native level. It directly utilizes the `libprotobuf-mutator` library to apply various mutation strategies, generating diverse and effective inputs for exploring program behavior. Its native implementation is crucial for achieving the high performance required in fuzzing.

### Python-Native Bridge
This component serves as the essential interface, bridging the Python-based fuzzing harness with the native C++ `Native Input Mutator`. It provides Pythonic wrappers and helper functions, enabling seamless data exchange and function calls between the Python fuzzing logic and the high-performance native mutation capabilities.
