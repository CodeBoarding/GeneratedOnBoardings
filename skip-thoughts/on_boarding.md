## Details

The `skip-thoughts` project is architected as a modular ML toolkit, primarily designed for generating and utilizing universal sentence embeddings. At its core, the **Skip-Thoughts Encoder** transforms raw text into dense vector representations. This encoder is trained by the **Training System**, which consumes preprocessed data supplied by the **Data Management** component. Once trained, the generated embeddings from the **Skip-Thoughts Encoder** serve as input for downstream applications, specifically the **Decoding System** for text generation and the **Evaluation System** for comprehensive performance assessment across various NLP tasks. This design emphasizes a clear pipeline from data ingestion and model training to embedding generation and subsequent application/evaluation, making it suitable for both research and integration into larger NLP workflows.

### Data Management
Handles the loading, preprocessing, and batching of textual datasets for training, encoding, and evaluation. Ensures data quality and efficient delivery.
