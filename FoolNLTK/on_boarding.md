## Details

FoolNLTK's architecture is designed around a modular approach to natural language processing, focusing on efficient lexical analysis and model management. The core of the system revolves around the `Lexical Analysis Core`, which orchestrates various NLP tasks like word segmentation, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition. This component heavily relies on the `Model Inference & Management` system for executing pre-trained models and the `User Dictionary` for incorporating custom vocabulary. The `User API & Orchestration` layer provides the primary interface for users, channeling text through the lexical analysis pipeline. While a `Model Training Pipeline` exists, its primary interaction is with the `Model Inference & Management` component, providing trained models for deployment rather than being directly involved in the real-time text processing flow. This clear separation of concerns facilitates maintainability and scalability, allowing for independent development and optimization of each functional area.

### User API & Orchestration
The primary interface for end-users to interact with the NLP functionalities. It handles initial text input and orchestrates calls to the core lexical analysis components.
