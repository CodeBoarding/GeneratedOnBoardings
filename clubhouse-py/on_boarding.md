## Details

The clubhouse-py architecture is centered around a CLI Application Core that orchestrates user interactions with the Clubhouse platform. This core component initiates the User Authentication & Onboarding process, which in turn leverages the Clubhouse API Client for secure session establishment. Once authenticated, the CLI Application Core can delegate to specialized modules like Real-time Channel Interaction for managing in-room activities, including chat and channel browsing. The Real-time Channel Interaction component can further trigger Speaker Permission Management for users seeking to speak. All these functional components ultimately rely on the Clubhouse API Client to abstract the complexities of direct communication with the Clubhouse backend, forming a clear client-server interaction pattern. This design ensures a modular and extensible structure, with distinct boundaries between the CLI logic and the underlying API communication.

### CLI Application Core [[Expand]](./CLI_Application_Core.md)
