## Details

The AlphaPy system is architected as a modular, pipeline-driven machine learning framework, designed to streamline quantitative finance and sports analytics workflows. At its core, the Workflow Orchestration component (alphapy/__main__.py, alphapy/market_flow.py, alphapy/sport_flow.py) orchestrates the entire process, initiating specific analytical pipelines. Data ingress is managed by the Data Management component (alphapy/data.py, alphapy/frame.py), which handles acquisition and loading. This raw data then flows into Feature Engineering (alphapy/features.py, alphapy/transforms.py) for transformation into a rich feature set. These features are consumed by Model Building & Optimization (alphapy/estimators.py, alphapy/optimize.py) to train and select machine learning models. Trained models are then passed to Model Persistence & Prediction (alphapy/model.py) for saving and generating predictions. The generated predictions are critical input for Backtesting & Strategy Simulation (alphapy/portfolio.py, alphapy/system.py), where trading strategies are rigorously evaluated. Finally, Reporting & Visualization (alphapy/plots.py, alphapy/analysis.py) provides comprehensive insights by consuming data and results from all key stages, offering visual and statistical analysis of the pipeline's performance. This clear component separation and sequential data flow are ideal for visual representation in a flow graph, highlighting the end-to-end ML pipeline.
