## Component Details

Functorch provides composable function transforms for PyTorch, enabling features like vectorization, automatic differentiation, and stateless functions. The core of functorch lies in its functional transforms like `vmap`, `grad`, `jacrev`, and `hessian`, which are used to manipulate and transform functions. These transforms are then utilized in various examples and applications, such as meta-learning, differential privacy, and ensembling. The library also provides tools for operator analysis and benchmarking, as well as integration with other libraries like `einops` for tensor manipulation. Named dimensions are introduced to improve code readability. Jupyter notebooks provide tutorials and examples for users to learn how to use Functorch.
