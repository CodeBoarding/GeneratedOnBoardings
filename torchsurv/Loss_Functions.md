## Details

Analysis of the Loss Functions Subsystem in the `torchsurv` project, detailing identified components and their interdependencies.

### Loss Functions [[Expand]](./Loss_Functions.md)
This component encapsulates various loss functions crucial for training survival models. These functions quantify the discrepancy between predicted and actual survival outcomes, guiding the model's learning process by providing a measure of error to be minimized during optimization. They are essential for enabling the training of robust survival prediction models.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### Tools
This component provides essential utility functions, primarily focusing on input validation. Its purpose is to ensure that data passed between different parts of the system, especially to sensitive computational components like loss functions, adheres to expected formats and constraints, thereby preventing errors and ensuring data integrity.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
