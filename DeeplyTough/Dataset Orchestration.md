## Component Details

This graph illustrates the `Dataset Orchestration` component's role in preparing protein structure datasets for model consumption. It shows how `Dataset Orchestration` integrates and processes raw data from `ToughM1`, `Vertex`, and `Prospeccts` datasets, and then initializes specialized `PdbPair Voxelized Dataset` instances. The `PdbPair Voxelized Dataset` and `PdbTuple Voxelized Dataset` components are built upon the `Voxelized Dataset Base`, demonstrating a clear inheritance hierarchy for handling voxelized data.

### Dataset Orchestration
This component is responsible for the high-level orchestration of dataset creation. It integrates various raw protein structure datasets, handles filtering and splitting, and initializes the specialized voxelized datasets for consumption by the model.
