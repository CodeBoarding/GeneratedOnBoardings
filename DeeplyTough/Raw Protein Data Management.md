## Component Details

This subsystem is responsible for the comprehensive management of raw protein data, encompassing initial preprocessing, retrieval, and organization from diverse datasets such as TOUGH-M1, Vertex, ProSPECCTS, and custom sources. It orchestrates the preparation of these datasets for downstream tasks, including data splitting, filtering, and the initialization of voxelized datasets for model training and evaluation. The core functionality revolves around specialized data handlers for each dataset type, ensuring data integrity and readiness for analysis.

### Raw Protein Data Management
This component manages the initial preprocessing and retrieval of protein structures from various raw datasets, including TOUGH-M1, Vertex, ProSPECCTS, and custom datasets. It acts as an overarching conceptual component for all individual data handlers.

### Dataset Orchestrator
This component is responsible for orchestrating the creation and preparation of the TOUGH-M1 dataset, integrating data from various sources like TOUGH-M1, Vertex, and ProSPECCTS. It handles preprocessing, data splitting into training and testing sets, and filtering based on specified criteria (e.g., excluding entries present in other datasets). It also initializes the final voxelized dataset for model training and evaluation.

### TOUGH-M1 Data Handler
This component manages the TOUGH-M1 dataset, including its preprocessing, structure retrieval, and splitting into training and testing subsets. It handles tasks like running `fpocket2` for pocket identification, mapping PDB chains to UniProt accessions, and evaluating pocket matching performance using AUC metrics.
