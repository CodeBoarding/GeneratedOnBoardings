## Details

The Training & Evaluation Engine is a fundamental component in this research-oriented deep learning application, serving as the central control unit for the entire model lifecycle. Its importance stems from its role in orchestrating the complex processes of model training, optimization, and rigorous performance evaluation, which are critical for deep learning research.

### Training & Evaluation Orchestrator
This component is the central orchestrator for the model's learning process and performance assessment. It manages the training loop, including optimizer configuration, learning rate scheduling, loss computation, logging metrics (e.g., to TensorBoard), and saving/resuming model checkpoints. It also initiates and coordinates benchmark evaluations to assess model performance against established datasets (PROSPECCTS, ToughM1, Vertex). It acts as the primary user interface for running experiments.
