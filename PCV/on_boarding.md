## Details

The PCV library is designed as a comprehensive, modular toolkit for computer vision, enabling users to construct complex image processing pipelines from distinct, reusable components. Its architecture is centered around functional decomposition, with specialized modules for tasks such as feature extraction, geometric transformations, image indexing, and classification. The library emphasizes the flow of processed image data and extracted features between these modules, supported by a robust set of general-purpose tools. This design facilitates clear separation of concerns, promoting both ease of use for individual algorithms and flexibility in combining them for advanced computer vision applications, all demonstrated through practical examples.
