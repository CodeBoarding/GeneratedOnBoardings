## Details

The two-factor authentication subsystem is structured around a central TwoFactorAuth model (two_factor.models.TwoFactorAuth) that orchestrates a user's 2FA settings. This model interacts with a hierarchy of OTP device implementations, all stemming from the abstract Device base class (django_otp.models.Device). Concrete device types, such as the PhoneDevice (two_factor.plugins.phonenumber.models.PhoneDevice), extend this base class to provide specific authentication mechanisms like SMS-based OTP. This design allows for flexible integration of various 2FA methods while maintaining a consistent interface for managing user authentication.
