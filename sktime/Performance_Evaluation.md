## Details

The `Performance Evaluation` subsystem in `sktime` provides a robust framework for assessing the performance of time series models. It is designed with a modular and extensible architecture, aligning with the project's overall focus on a Machine Learning Library/Framework for Time Series.

### Benchmarking Orchestrator
This component is responsible for defining, configuring, and executing performance benchmarks for time series models. It manages the setup of experiments, including the selection of datasets, models, and evaluation strategies, and orchestrates the execution of these experiments to generate raw performance data. It acts as the primary control point for initiating performance assessment runs.

### Evaluation Engine
This component processes the raw results generated by the `Benchmarking Orchestrator`. It applies various statistical methods and metrics to analyze model performance, compare different models, and derive actionable insights. The `Evaluation Engine` is responsible for transforming raw experimental data into meaningful performance assessments, including statistical tests, result aggregation, and potentially visualization preparation.

### Forecasting Metric Base
This component defines the standardized interface and provides common utility functions for all forecasting error metrics used within the `Performance Evaluation` subsystem. It ensures consistency in how metrics are defined, calculated, and integrated, handling aspects like input validation, data type coercion, and sample weighting before delegating the actual computation to specific metric implementations.
